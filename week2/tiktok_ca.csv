"April 9, 2024","""Exploitation is just so rife:"" HBO's ""Brandy Hellville"" rips open the seam on fast fashion's woes",1,"  Link to Image One size fits all. Tiny tank tops. A toxic image of whiteness and beauty tailored for young, rich teenage girls. These are all elements that underpin the trendy, bohemian fast fashion brand, Brandy Melville. While the Italian brand has been open since the 1980s, it hit its stride in America when it opened up shop in Los Angeles in 2009. But really, Brandy Melville is known to any woman under the age of 30 for its peak Tumblr and Instagram influence. During the launch of the digital boom with social media like Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr and YouTube, the brand capitalized on the mere beginnings of influencer culture. Brandy Melville used teenage girls posting online about its clothing as a way to advertise their super soft, one-size-fits-all baby t-shirts and its beach aesthetic to other plugged-in teenage girls. They would then recruit young, beautiful girls to either work and model for its stores across the country. Almost instantaneously, the brand became a cult favorite amongst any teenager with an eye for trendy fashion. But despite Brandy's popularity with the youth and in social media culture, amassing an Instagram page of 3 million followers, it has been swept up in a vortex of controversy since the late 2010s. In my heyday as a teenager, socially aware people on the internet branded together to boycott Brandy altogether for its lack of size inclusivity, but attempts were unsuccessful. But in 2021, a bombshell article by Business Insider reporter Kate Taylor exposed its fast fashion model for allegations of fatophobia, racism against Black and brown ex-employees and odd and inappropriate behavior with underage teenage girls. Then, a group chat between Brandy Melville CEO Stephen Marsan and other company employees was leaked and revealed a number of antisemitic, anti-Black and misogynistic messages. This has led to two discrimination lawsuits against the brand and Marsan. The HBO documentary, ""Brandy Hellville & the Cult of Fast Fashion"" -which debuts on HBO and Max at 9 p.m. on April 9 - rips open the cheaply made seam that holds together the loosely woven lies that lucrative fast fashion brands like Brandy Melville tell to exploit young, female retail workers all the way down the supply chain.  Salon talked to director Eva Orner about whistleblowers, the global impact of fast fashion and how ""the power is with the consumer, but they're being duped.""  The following transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity. I also grew up in the age of Tumblr, so I knew a lot about Brandy. What did you know about Brandy Melville before you took on this documentary and did you know about its cult following? It's interesting I wanted to do something about fashion and particularly fast fashion and I was looking for the right story. I had a meeting with the producers Jonathan and Simon Chinn, who are amazing from the company Lightbox. We talked about it and they came back a few months later with the Brandy Melville story. You know, I'm not the age of you. I don't have a teenage daughter and I didn't know what it was. I did a bit of a deep dive and I was like, 'This is amazing.' So I didn't know anything. The first thing I did was ask my friends with teenage daughters, and they were all like, 'oh my god, my daughter's obsessed with it.' I went and looked at their closets and I talked to them about it. And then the one thing that I wanted to do was also open the story up to make it a little bigger about the implications of where all of this excess clothing goes. That's why we went to Italy and we also went to Prato to Ghana to tell a bigger story. So I didn't know Brandy! People know about Brandy because it capitalized on influencer culture. I think it was really successful because of that. During your interviews, what did you uncover about young girls' relationships with social media? I say this about all of us because I don't want to just blame young girl on this. But you know, it's addictive and it's captivating and I think we're all a bit obsessed with it and we spend too much time on it. You know, I have the odd friend like my fianc - he's not on any social media and never has been. It's really interesting to watch his life as opposed to my life. I'm not super consumed. But you know, [teenage girls] grew up with it and this is how they communicate and this is what they do and people want big followings. People want to be influencers - Brandy encouraged like crazy. The biggest thing for me is when I look at all my friends' teenage daughters, they are basically unpaid brand ambassadors for all of these companies and it's genius, evil genius of the companies. It's horrifying. Right now on TikTok, the biggest trend I think is face care for young girls. So there's all these girls between probably five, eight years old and 15 years old and they buy all this expensive face product. Then [they] make videos of it and then they post it and millions of people see it and replicate it. I mean, the companies are laughing all the way to the bank. They don't have to advertise. It's insane and I think exposing it is really important because if we - if they stopped, the companies would collapse. I think you realize the power is with the consumer, but they're being duped.  At the center of this is Brandy Melville's CEO, Stephan Marsan. We discover in the documentary that he's this middle-aged white man shrouded in mystery. How did you begin deconstructing this elusive figure and boss? And where did you start considering the numerous allegations of racism, antisemitism and discrimination against him? A lot of stemmed from Kate Taylor's Business Insider article. That was sort of the jumping off point. Then once you start talking to people, you find out more and more and more. Obviously, the two Italian men agreed to appear in the film anonymously. That's not them. That's actors playing them in the film, but off their transcripts. I think it's really hard when you have to make a film and the antagonist is a shadowy figure and there's literally three photos of him online. There's absolutely nothing about this man online. It's really extraordinary. And what's even more horrifying is he spends his days gathering photos of young girls who work for him. So there's tons of material of them. I mean, the exploitation is just so rife, but nothing of him. And then when you see him, it's really inappropriate, who he is and what he's doing. And it's the same as his offsider, Jessie, who was running the Instagram; he's equally the same. He is managing these teenage girls and again, he's a middle-aged man. It just feels really wrong and incredibly exploitive and the industry is such an exploitative industry. The fashion industry is mostly female workers are all being exploited, whether they're models down to the workers, and it's mostly run by men. You've mentioned two actors speaking from transcripts, how did that process go? Because these two people are involved in a discrimination lawsuit against Brandy and they decided to stay anonymous. Was it challenging to film all? I mean, everything in this film was really challenging. It was actually surprising because I've done a lot of stuff in war zones and with refugees, and there I haven't had that kind of hesitancy to go on camera. I mean, starting with the girls - and I really liked to point this out - we spoke to so many girls and reached out to so many girls and ex- and current employees and like 95% of them said no to being in the film. They would share their stories often, not always, but there's a level of fear, you know, fear of retribution. They're scared of the people who own the company, but they're also young girls starting their careers, so they're scared of going on camera sort of forever and it could stop them from getting a job. So, my first thing is that all of the young women who appear in the film are the heroes of this story. They are whistleblowers. They are brave. Most of them said no, and I cannot show my gratitude and awe of how strong and brave they are. It's an example of when young women speak out, they have a powerful voice and I think that needs to be galvanized more and they need to be manipulated less. So, I think that was a really amazing thing. And the two Italians who I have mentioned and - I'm actually in Kate's article, and so we were introduced to their attorney, and then it was a lot of negotiation from 'maybe,' to 'yes, but I don't want to be on camera' and 'no, you can't use my voice.'  So I said we can do a Zoom interview that I record, we'll cut it into the film. And then once we're pretty much locked, we will have actors sit in silhouette, reading from your transcripts, and they agreed to that and I think it works really well. I think it's really effective. I think you just go with it and forget that they are actors. We brought Italians to play them because their Italian [had] strong Italian accents. Honestly, I really didn't even fit the pieces together until you mentioned that because it felt like they were actually them. So it was a success. That's why I didn't show their faces.  But again, I feel like they didn't have to speak and are really brave to do it. And I feel like whenever you have a whistleblower in a film, without whistleblowers, we are in the dark, we are in big trouble. And I think whistleblowers are getting more and more concerned and scared to speak because of laws changing and governments changing and journalists are the same. So I'm always like, without these incredibly brave people, we have nothing.  You highlight the environmental cost of fast fashion, and it's laid out perfectly from the beginning of the supply chain with exploited textile workers to exploited teenage retail workers. Why do you feel like it was important to highlight the stark racial and environmental inequity in fashion? It would have made my life a lot easier to just stick with an expose on Brandy, but I wanted to get to the end of the film and to have people more informed about the global impact of buying a t-shirt and their choices. And I thought, honestly, when you see those images from Ghana, from the beach in Accra - my crew and I have shot in war zones and we've seen the worst of humanity and the best and standing on that beach for the first day in Ghana our jaws were on the floor, and we were kind of like, ""This is one of the worst things we've ever seen."" I mean, I'm literally getting chills. It was so shocking. And you realize you're part of the problem. It's so shocking. So I really wanted that to be in the film. And I wanted you to get to the end of the film, and this is why the last line of the film is 'We need to buy less.' Look there's lots of different technologies and solutions that are in progress at the minute, but I'm just checking my facts. 100 billion garments are produced nearly globally and most of those are discarded in the first year of wearing them. We don't need as much as we have. We don't need these massive closets.  In terms of just day to day, we just need to buy less, and if our buying went down even 20%, 30%, 40%, - I mean, let's go for 80% or 90% - but even if you've just stopped buying 30% of what you're buying now, if everyone did that, it would make an impact.  It would really hit the businesses who are making all this excess product that we don't need. Lee is one of the women who works in Ghana [and she says], 'You know we've we've made enough clothing we don't need to make any clothing.' So I really just hope that people see this film. Everyone who worked on the film is affected. We've all cut down our consumption by probably 70-80%. It's really, just take a minute and don't buy it instantly. That's what the algorithms are trying to make you do.  The image that Brandy has created to sell their clothes is this Western standard of beauty: White, blond, light eyes, skinny and beautiful. While interviewing all of these former Brandy employees, how do you feel that this ideal may have affected them long term? And what does it say about our culture that this is still the beauty standard perpetuated in fashion? Kate Taylor, who was the initial journalist who uncovered this, is in the film. She says at the beginning of the film, 'I didn't think that's what this generation was about.' You know, there's so much inclusivity and diversity, but that is a new thing that didn't exist when we were growing up. Maybe [diversity and inclusion] is not as deep as we really think it is because something like Brandy exists. What's great is that the ex-employees, who are in the film really spoke about it honestly, I love their honesty. I love when Natasha says 'I don't know why we wore it because everyone wore it.' That's exactly what we all did at school and it's very easy to make fun of that, but to me, that honesty is extraordinary. When Kate says she felt amazing when she was complimented in a Brandy store and you know, it was like being a cool girl, and that's fine. That's what growing up is all about, but this company exploits that. Did doing this documentary make you look at clothing and the fashion business differently in your own life? It's so interesting because I love fashion and that's how this all started. I mean, I love watching fashion documentaries. I loved you know, not buying excessively, but I definitely have too much stuff. I think it's made me not like the fashion business and to not be as interested in it. I'm interested in the kind of designers doing real work with recycling, like the company in Italy, Manteco, who makes all that incredible, like cashmere and recycled wool. To me, that's sexy and interesting, taking all our old woolen cashmere and turning it into a gorgeous product. To me, that's interesting and it needs to be scaled up. So, I feel like now I'm more interested in the activism. Aisha, who is a woman in the film, runs an organization called Remake which is all about activism and campaigning. I sort of switched my focus to 'I still want to look nice and be fashionable and look at fashion, but I don't want to read fashion magazines.' I'm also incredibly critical and have very little patience for companies that call themselves sustainable and they're not. I feel like everyone's doing it. You can have one organic t-shirt in your line and say you're sustainable because there's no regulation in the global fashion industry. You go on any website and it says sustainable and you feel good about what you're buying and it's simply not, it's just greenwashing, you know? To be truly sustainable means not making something new. How does this documentary fit in with your other work? I know that you've done exploration into Bikram yoga and the Ohio State University abuse scandal. What about these stories have a common theme? I'm just definitely into exposes these days. I'm definitely into giving a voice to people doing good, representing the underdog. You know, I historically did a lot of films in war zones with refugees, and I'm not known for doing easy films. When I said I love fashion, I'd love to do something in fashion, I'm very quick to say, 'But I don't want to do a celebrity designer piece.' So I wanted to do something about fast fashion. To me, it's about exploration, discovery, meeting people and going to places that I would never meet and that I've never been to. I find that endlessly fascinating and I'm so blessed that I get to do this. I do like a little bit of edge to what I do. I feel like you can lure an audience into something and then maybe they walk away with slightly changed behavior, whether it's more empathy towards a refugee or whether it's being more thoughtful about waste and what you buy. So I kind of like not banging people over the head with things, subtly drawing them in, educating them and maybe changing their behavior a tiny bit for the better if that's possible. But at the end of the day for me, it's about stories. You know, when people bring you things or you come across things, you know instantly if it's something you want to spend a few years of your life on.

"March 10, 2024","""Let them eat cereal"": How accusations of ""greedflation"" fueled consumer ire against Kellogg's",2,"  Link to Image Since 2022, Kellogg has been running an ad campaign encouraging families, with the help of Tony the Tiger and Toucan Sam, to break out of their boring dinner rotation and swap in the occasional bowl ofcereal. ""If you're tired of cooking chicken over and over (and the kids are bored of eating it) we've got something you'll want to try,"" the description for one of the advertisements read. ""Turn off the stove, pop open the pantry and pour your favorite Kellogg's cereal for dinner!"" That commercial didn't inspire nearly the same amount of dialogue as when - nearly two years later, on Feb. 21 - WK Kellogg Co. CEO Gary Pilnickalso suggested customers eat cereal for dinner, likely because instead of positioning it, as the advertisement had, as a little treat, he suggested it as a solution for families feeling throttled by food inflation.  ""The cereal category has always been quite affordable, and it tends to be a great destination when consumers are under pressure,"" Pilnick said in an interview with CNBC. ""If you think about the cost of cereal for a family versus what they might otherwise do, that's going to be much more affordable."" He isn't wrong; the average price per box of cereal in the U.S. is around $3.27 and, when speaking with CNBC, Pilnick estimated that a serving with milk in fruit would cost about $1. However, his comments didn't sit well with many viewers and consumer advocates who quickly pointed out that the price per unit of Kellogg's products was up by 17.1% in Octobercompared with the same month a year earlier, the highest increase among ready-to-eat cereal brands.  This has led to widespread calls for a boycott of Kellogg's products, which could potentially spark the boycott of other food companies that are perceived to be similarly squeezing their customers during a period of time when, as reported by Pew, more than 90% of Americans say they are ""very"" or ""somewhat"" concerned about the price of food - especially because the boycott is reportedly already starting to produce some results.  ""There's no reason for you to jack up your prices the way you did, except to screw us,"" TikTok user@TallGirl6234 saidin a now-viral video posted in February. ""And you know what? Now we're going to screw you - while eating some other brand's cereal."" The success of the video has launched the hashtag #letthemeatcereal as well as associated website Let Them Eat Cereal, which provides resources for customers who want to participate in a boycott of Kellogg's products ""from April 1 to June 30th (2024 Q2) by buying the store brand, making your own, and sharing resources for others to get involved.""  ""Boycotting Kellogg and other mega corporations isn't easy, and this is intentional,"" they continue. ""It is an excellent way to use collective action for change though.""  This period of sustained grocery inflation, even as the price of other goods comes down, has caused frustration for a lot of American customers. As Abha Bhattarai and Jeff Stein wrote for the Washington Post, there are a lot of complex, interlocking reasons why the cost of food at the supermarket is still up. ""Prices remain elevated due to a mixture of labor shortages tied to the pandemic, ongoing supply chain disruptions, droughts, avian flu and other factors far beyond the [Biden] administration's control,"" they wrote.  However, economic experts and everyday Americans are both increasingly talking about how ""greedflation"" is potentially impacting the cost of goods.  ""The idea that profits drove our current bout of inflation surfaced in the last few years among progressive economists and lawmakers but was waved away by more mainstream types as a 'conspiracy theory,'"" wrote Emily Peck for Axioslast summer. ""That changed earlier this year. In a speech in January, then-Fed vice chair Lael Brainard said wages weren't the main driver of inflation and pointed to a 'price-price spiral,' where companies mark up prices far higher than the increases in their input costs.""  Companies, some customers would say, like Kellogg. There are reports that the calls for the boycott of the brand are already starting to have some effect. As reported on Friday by the Daily Dot, some shoppers have already started to see Kellogg's cereals for prices as low as 99 cents on supermarket shelves. In a viral TikTok video, user Marc Fazon found similar prices at his store.  ""Yo, this is the cheapest I've ever seen cereal be,"" he said. ""Ninety-nine cent, nah, the protest is working y'all, keep doing it."" Kellogg isn't the only company facing increased scrutiny - or the threat of boycott - from disgruntled customers. Let Them Eat Cereal has already posted plans to boycott three additional companiesin the next calendar year: Netstl , Coca-Cola and Exxon.

"October 7, 2023","""Real-world harm"": Schools targeted by Libs of TikTok evacuated after reported bomb threats",3,"  Link to Image In the past month, the social media account ""Libs of TikTok,"" targeted around eleven schools or school districts over anti-LGBTQ+ grooming conspiracies. Shortly after these attacks, some of the targeted institutions received bomb threats, according to an investigation by Vice News. Chaya Raichik, the individual behind the account, has employed right-wing ""groomer"" propaganda to target 42 school districts and their staff members. Her accusations have centered on false allegations of these institutions ""indoctrinating"" children into LGBTQ+ identities and exposing them to sexually explicit content, according to the report. Of the 42 institutions that Vice reached out to, 11 schools or school districts reported receiving bomb threats while a majority didn't respond. And only three school districts said that they hadn't received bomb threats as a result of being featured in a Libs of TikTok post. Although the school districts couldn't definitively attribute the bomb threats to Raichik's followers, the ones that did receive threats indicated a ""disturbing pattern"" - they received threats within five days of being featured in Raichik's post, district officials told Vice. These accounts claim that they are ""protecting"" children, but ""that's not the main goal of many of their posts,"" Sarah Moore, an anti-LGBTQ+ extremism analyst at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in partnership with Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), told Salon. One school in Salem, Massachusetts, was featured in a Libs of TikTok post on September 12, and received emailed bomb threats on September 15, 19, and 21, leading to evacuations, Vice News found.  Another was an elementary school near Chicago, which was highlighted in a post on September 15. Over the next four days, the school encountered three threats. The last bomb threat the district received was 25 years ago, a spokesperson from the North Shore School District, told the outlet. A school in Oklahoma City featured in three Libs of TikTok posts had the state superintendent of education in Oklahoma post a photo with Raichik, lauding her for promoting transparency and accountability in schools, surpassing the efforts of many elected officials. Meanwhile, an elementary school in Western Heights ISD received a bomb threat, Vice News reported.  It comes as no surprise that schools or individuals featured by Libs of TikTok often become targets of relentless trolling, harassment and in some cases even real threats. Last summer, hospitals faced bomb threats after Libs of TikTok began highlighting that they offered gender-affirming care to transgender youth. The Boston Children's Hospital received a deluge of harassing emails ""including threats of violence"" toward their staff after Raichik falsely claimed on Aug. 11 that the hospital performs hysterectomies on children, The Washington Post reported. The hospital does provide hysterectomies to certain patients over 18. Raichik leveled a similar accusation against Children's National Hospital in Washington. On August 25, she posted a recording in which she questioned two unidentified hospital employees about the availability of gender-affirming hysterectomies for 16-year-old patients.  Both employees mistakenly stated that the procedure was offered to 16-year-olds, and one even suggested it might be available to even younger patients. However, the hospital clarified that this information was incorrect and that neither of the employees was involved in patient care.  After the recording was posted to Twitter, and was played more than 1.1 million times, Children's National was inundated with threatening emails and phone calls, a hospital spokeswoman told The Post. Libs of TikTok has been a significant driver in fueling the baseless ""grooming"" conspiracy theory, co-opted by some right-wing politicians and pundits. The trope has found its way into mainstream conversations, particularly as Republicans have actively opposed LGBTQ+ rights and introduced policies aimed at undermining them in recent years. The ""Don't Say Gay"" bill for example has been referred to as the ""anti-grooming bill,"" with advocates of the bill accusing opponents of preying on children.  The Anti-Defamation League and GLAAD published a report this June, which documented the rise in anti-LGBTQ+ incidents across the U.S. and found that more than half of them were linked to the ""groomer"" trope.  One of the other facets that they identified was the types of ""conspiratorial tropes"" that were linked to cases of real-world harm and found that about a third, or at least 191 of the cases, that ""included acts of real-world harm, were directly linked to tropes regarding the grooming conspiracy theory,"" Moore said.  ""So we know that there is a really significant overlap between folks sharing these conspiracy theories online, and then folks getting targeted as a result of the spread of that rhetoric,"" she added.  Raichik has also gained support from notable figures on the right as her account on X, the platform formally known as Twitter, has grown to 2.5 million followers. She has dined with former President Donald Trump and members of Congress frequently interact with content from Libs of TikTok.  Right-wing influencers consistently boost posts from the account, thereby broadening its reach. This places the responsibility on social media platforms to curb the spread of hate online, but little has been done to address this growing issue, advocates say. ""We've seen a number of cases where the platforms themselves need to uphold their policies about hateful content when they're seeing these big accounts that have these large followings violate that content,"" Moore said. ""They should also be aware, at the same time, of what are the cases of real-world harm that's happening in direct correspondence to some of these posts."" There have been a number of instances where there's a ""clear violation"" of the terms of services of platforms and the content that Libs of TikTok is posting, she added. Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course. ​​YouTube's harassment policy, for example, provides specific instances of prohibited content, one of which involves targeting an individual due to their affiliation with a protected group. However, Libs of TikTok posted a video titled ""The Top TEN Worst TikTok Videos of 2021"" on their YouTube channel, where they reviewed videos created by individuals they assume to be transgender or part of the LGBTQ+ community, making negative comments about their appearance, Moore said.  ""This video should therefore be sanctioned under YouTube's policies,"" she said.  In addition to holding platforms accountable, Moore pointed out that addressing the targeting of the LGBTQ+ community is a broader societal concern that calls for a ""full society response."" The ADL is exploring different ideas to mitigate online harm, whether that includes the development of anti-doxxing legislation and other legislative measures that can be used to target those responsible for online harm, Moore said. At the same time, GLAAD is ""promoting a positive representation of the LGBTQ+ community on media outlets.""

"March 22, 2024","'A Walking Testimony' mental health advocate visits Sonoma County on walk across America, tells locals 'you matter'",4,"  Mar. 22—For nearly 500 days, Florida native Kyndal Ray Edwards has been walking across the United States toting a ""You Matter"" sign, and spreading a message of mental health awareness. This week he made his way to Sonoma County and shared his story with local students and people in recovery. In a word, Edwards said in a phone call Thursday from a hotel that his trek down the Pacific Coast Highway, which will take him to the Golden Gate Bridge on March 30, has been ""epic."" ""I'm from a huge city, so we don't see stuff like this,"" Edwards said of west Sonoma County's rolling hills and small towns. ""Highway One has been insane. It's one of the most challenging yet rewarding roads that can be walked because every sight is just absolutely gorgeous."" Since leaving from his home in Jacksonville, Florida, on Jan. 1, 2022, Edwards has been trekking west, then south, as part of a journey he calls ""A Walking Testimony"" that will eventually take him to all four corners of the lower 48 states. Along the way he documents his journey on social media and speaks to people on the road and to groups and schools he connects with online. ""The main thing I do is share my story every single day, multiple times a day,"" he said. Before embarking on his walk, Edwards said he dealt with depression, drug use and a life of crime in Florida. After reading an article in 2013 about a University of South Florida student, Harrison Milanian, who walked across America to raise awareness about fitness, he became inspired to do the same, but continued drug use landed him a five-and-a-half-year prison sentence in 2015. During his incarceration, he said he finally turned his life around and is now nearly five years sober and over 4,600 miles into his walk, having crossed from Florida to the northwest corner of Washington. He's on his way to San Diego before returning to Florida and walking to Maine. While making his way through the North Bay, Edwards has seen Salt Point State Park, Fort Ross, Valley Ford, Bodega Bay and the famous schoolhouse from ""The Birds"" in the town of Bodega. He also stopped at the Olympia House Rehab center in Petaluma on Wednesday to speak to staff and clients and spoke to students at a Tomales elementary school Thursday. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kyndal Ray (@a_walking_testimony) At the center of his message is that ""You Matter."" This device is unable to display framed content. Click here to view this embed. ""I tell people that they are loved and they have value and purpose and they matter,"" Edwards said. ""And I tell people that when it comes to recovery, a support system is amazing, but none of it is going to work unless you want it to work. Recovery is hard if you don't have good mental health, that's the center of everything if you ask me."" Throughout his two-year journey, Edwards has faced setbacks, including hernia surgery and challenges like a walk through the Rocky Mountains in winter, but said his self-determination to complete his goal keeps him on the road. ""I thrive off of accomplishments after giving myself a goal, especially a challenging goal,"" he said. ""That stretch from Leggett (in Mendocino County) to the coast was one of the hardest days on my journey. I did 1,900 feet of elevation climbing on winding roads with semis coming at me all day. At the end of it, I was jumping around ecstatic because I had completed something super challenging."" Edwards funds his journey by selling ""A Walking Testimony"" merchandise online and accepts donations and lodging from the 44,000 people who follow him on TikTok and other social media platforms. He said people he meets every day keep him motivated to keep walking, from those who see his ""You Matter"" sign and stop to talk, to those who share their own stories of dealing with addiction or depression. ""Almost 90% of comments (on social media) are somebody saying how much of an inspiration this journey is or what this journey is doing for them, it's stuff like that that keeps me going,"" he said. In addition to following his walk on social media, Edwards encourages people to share his message and advocate for mental health and addiction recovery in their own ways. He also invites those who want to walk with him to join him on March 30 for his trip across the Golden Gate Bridge. The day will mark his 31st birthday and his 500th day of walking. Edwards will begin his walk from the Sausalito side at 1 p.m., holding his ""You Matter"" sign, and will then make his way through the city. ""Anybody that can see the sign, we just want them to know that they matter,"" he said.

"January 24, 2024",'After Midnight' Opening Week Ratings: #ThisIsFine,5,"  The first week of After Midnight on CBS brought in viewing numbers that are, well, about what would be expected for a network show airing at 12:37 a.m. in 2024. The show, an expanded and updated take on Comedy Central's @midnight that's hosted by Taylor Tomlinson, averaged 579,000 same-day viewers for its first three installments, according to Nielsen. The Jan. 16 premiere drew 686,000 viewers, based on preliminary figures, which would mean the subsequent two episodes averaged about 525,000 viewers.  Delayed viewing numbers are somewhat rosier: After three days (and not including streaming), After Midnight rose to 819,000 viewers for its first week. Its DVR lift of 240,000 viewers is more than three times bigger than that of The Late Late Show With James Corden (77,000) in the 2022-23 season. After Midnight is CBS' replacement for The Late Late Show, which ended 28-year run, the last eight with Corden as host, in April 2023. The show takes a tour through internet culture, with comedians riffing on TikTok posts, influencers and other online ephemera. CBS announced Wednesday that After Midnight and its lead-in, The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, will both get Super Bowl Sunday showcases, airing in their regular time periods following local news that night. The same-day, on-air ratings for After Midnight's first week fall short of Corden's final season of The Late Late Show, which averaged about 800,000 nightly viewers (although again, delayed viewing closes the gap considerably). But given the ongoing declines in night-of, linear TV viewing, the early returns on After Midnight aren't that surprising.  The other 12:30-ish network show, NBC's Late Night With Seth Meyers, is drawing 795,000 viewers per night with new episodes this season. At 11:35 p.m., The Late Show leads with 1.85 million viewers per night, beating out ABC's Jimmy Kimmel Live (1.59 million) and NBC's Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon (1.32 million). Including delayed viewing (over seven days for most of the season), The Late Show rises to 2.58 million; Jimmy Kimmel Live to 1.77 million; The Tonight Show to 1.43 million; and Late Night to 970,000. No seven-day figures for After Midnight are available yet, but it will add some more viewers to the 819,000 three-day figure. In the key ad-sales demographic of adults 18-49, Kimmel leads with 244,000 same-day viewers, edging Fallon (229,000) and Colbert (193,000). Meyers draws 146,000 adults 18-49 per night, and the first three After Midnights averaged 95,000 in the demo. Since it's a show about internet culture, CBS will also be keeping an eye on After Midnight's social media performance. The show has close to 130,000 Instagram followers and about 59,000 on TikTok (as of publication time); a couple of its Instagram Reels and one TikTok post are approaching 2 million views (both platforms count a view as one second seeing a video). On YouTube, After Midnight has 61,000 subscribers a week after its TV premiere; the full first episode has garnered 1.1 million views (YouTube counts views after 30 seconds), and seven other clips - five full segments of the show and two YouTube Shorts - have crossed the 100,000-view mark so far.

"January 18, 2024",'Anyone But You': How TikTok (and Shakespeare) Saved the Romantic Comedy From the Theatrical Graveyard,6,"  TikTok may have just saved romantic comedies from being banished forever from the big screen to the hinterlands of streaming. Sony's Anyone But You, based on Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, has become a box office darling and could reach $85 million to $100 million domestically against a $25 million budget, despite mediocre reviews and an equally meh B+ CinemaScore. It has impressed Hollywood to the point where normally adversarial studio heads are gushing over the film's astounding run as if it were their own. After opening to a lowly $8 million over Christmas weekend, the Sydney Sweeney and Glen Powell romancer went viral after moviegoers began flooding TikTok with videos of themselves reenacting the film's credit sequence, which is overlaid with actors from the film dancing to and singing snippets of Natasha Bedingfield's 2004 single ""Unwritten."" The self-made videos have become so well known that in cinemas across the country, many audience members seem to be waiting for the end so they can begin singing and waving their arms. In its second weekend, Anyone But You spiked 45.6 percent, the third-best hold of any wide release in history behind The Greatest Showman (another Christmas film people wrote off when it didn't exactly wow in its launch) and Cheaper by the Dozen. And it became the first Christmas release in history to earn more in its third weekend ($9.8 million) than in its opening. The movie is also over-performing overseas, where it has amassed $22.8 million. All of this upends the argument that rom-coms are the purview of streaming now, and that younger folks aren't interested in seeing them on the big screen as a communal experience as they would with a horror film. One rival studio executive tells THR they couldn't be more pleased since it's a genre that deserves a life on the big screen. ""I don't think this age group, which is 18-24, has been offered these movies theatrically,"" says the exec. Anyone But You director Will Gluck sees the story as lending itself to the communal experience. ""Shakespeare mounted his plays in front of audiences at the Globe Theatre 400 years ago, and these types of stories are still viable in front of audiences in movie theaters today,"" Gluck says. ""I feel the most important thing that's been missing these last few years is sharing rom-coms with other people."" TikTok is the perfect place to grow interest in a film among younger demographics and spark the thing needed most of all for a movie's success - word of mouth. The platform has been important to Hollywood marketers since its rise last decade, but its importance increased a hundred-fold during the pandemic, when usage spiked.  Custom content and stunts can spread like wildfire on TikTok in a way they can't on more traditional marketing platforms. A video of Miles Teller dancing at the Cannes Film Festival at the 2022 world premiere of Top Gun: Maverick went viral on TikTok and became a moment. Younger people were hardly the movie's target audience, yet they played a big role in helping Top Gun 2 soar to $1.45 billion in global ticket sales. (And don't forget about TikTok in terms of helping to spawn the Barbenheimer moniker and resulting phenomenon last summer.) More recently, Paramount relied heavily on TikTok when marketing the new Mean Girls movie, which along with Warner Bros.' Wonka, and to some degree, fellow Warners title The Color Purple, have punched at least a hole in the theory that musicals (like rom-coms) can't work anymore on the big screen. One trick: Paramount released the entire first Mean Girls movie in 10-minute segments for free on Tiktok. Sony likewise leaned heavily into creating custom content for TikTok, including stunts between stars Sweeney and Powell. One piece of them whispering to each other got more views on TikTok than the official trailer, or 18 million versus 10 million (the on-set chemistry between the two rising stars was the subject of many tabloid headlines). And the suggestion that viewers post their own re-creation of the credit sequence was initially planted by Sony as a sort of call-to-action. The studio encouraged people to record those reactions on their cellphones and then pushed those recordings out on company's own channels. Sweeney, who has millions of followers, also reposted many of the re-creations on her various social channels. As one marketing president at a rival studio says, ""You have to know how to find people where they live. And the world needs some fun right now. This movie has hit a nerve because of TikTok."" By the week of Jan. 16, the Anyone But You hashtag surpassed 1.2 billion views on TikTok, while the ""Unwritten"" hashtag boasted 289.9 million views and more than 24,500 posts. Additionally, the song ""Unwritten"" has made its first appearance on Spotify's U.S. top 200 chart.  ""People can sense when things feel artificially 'eventized.' It has to happen organically. I think this movie took off because the audience made it an event themselves,"" Gluck says.  At a sold-out Sunday afternoon screening at L.A.'s AMC Grove Theatre on Jan. 14, two USC students told THR they were prompted to see the film because of all the TikTok attention. ""We heard about it all from TikTok. All of our friends wanted to see it, "" says one of the young women, who didn't want to reveal their names. For them it was a throwback to the rom-coms of the early 2000s they watched as young girls on home entertainment (27 Dresses, 13 Going on 30, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days). ""This is the first romance-comedy that has that same energy and we absolutely wanted to see it with other people. It's what makes it 10 times better,"" said one of the USC students. Added her friend, ""and Sydney and Glen had very good chemistry on the TikTok promos they did.""  Gluck is coy when asked if there might be an Anyone But You sequel, but says he, Sweeney and Powell certainly want to work together again.

"March 22, 2024","'Blue's Clues' host checks in after 'Quiet on Set,' making grown fans emotional",7,"  Former ""Blue's Clues"" host Steve Burns has conducted therapeutic check-ins with his TikTok followers occasionally since 2021 - but a recent upload hit viewers harder than usual. This week, Investigation Discovery released a four-part docuseries, ""Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV,""which revealed the toxic culture behind some of the most popular Nickelodeon shows of the late 1990s and early 2000s. For many who were raised on the network's programs, the documentary revised previously rosy childhood memories.  In a video, uploaded Thursday, Burns asks viewers with a knowing gaze, ""Hey, I'm checking in. Tell me, what's going on?"" Then, for nearly a minute, he nods quietly as though listening to them respond. As the video draws to a close, he says a simple ""OK,"" and after one last pause finishes with, ""All right, well, it's good to hear from you. And you look great, by the way."" The TikTok now has more than 3.5 million views, and nearly 30,000 users have left comments expressing everything from despair to gratitude. ""After the Nickelodeon documentary Steve all I need is my blues clues to save whatever is left of this childhood I once had,"" one user wrote. ""Steve checking up on the now grown up kids he left behind is another level of full circle moment,"" another penned. While some shared what they had said to their screens, others admitted they couldn't do anything but cry. Resharing the video on X (formerly Twitter), one fan wrote, ""Steve from Blues Clues posting this after the Nickelodeon documentary, he knew exactly what we needed."" The post has since garnered thousands of retweets. Burns led ""Blue's Clues"" from the show's premiere on Nick Jr. in 1996 until 2002, when viewers were told his character was leaving for college. Conspiracy theories surrounding Burns' departure abounded, but in the end, the truth was not so complicated. ""It was just simply time to go,"" Burns told the Huffington Post in 2016. ""I was pretty much playing a boyish, older-brotherish kind of character on the show. I was getting older; I was losing my hair; a lot of the original gangsters on the show, like the people who created it, were all moving on to other careers. It just felt like time."" It was only after he left that he began to confront some harder truths about that season of his life, he told Variety in 2022. ""I didn't know it yet, but I was the happiest depressed person in North America,"" Burns said. ""I was struggling with severe clinical depression the whole time I was on that show. It was my job to be utterly and completely full of joy and wonder at all times, and that became impossible.  ""I was always able to dig and find something that felt authentic to me that was good enough to be on the show,"" he said, ""but after years and years of going to the well without replenishing it, there was a cost."" After what Burns called ""a long period of healing"" following his exit from the children's show, he recently returned to the ""Blue's Clues"" universe in the Paramount+ revival series ""Blue's Clues and You,"" which debuted in 2019, and the 2022 movie ""Blue's Big City Adventure."" Since reentering the public eye, he told Variety, he has taken great delight in speaking to college students about mental health and the resources he sought out to improve his own. ""Steve became my role model,"" Burns said of his character from the show, ""because he was not afraid to ask for help.""  This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"February 29, 2024",'Go back to China': Sawtelle woman caught in racist rant over unleashed dog,9,"  A dispute between two women over an unleashed dog on the Westside of Los Angeles took on racist tones when the woman whose dog was off leash told her Asian neighbor to ""go back to China,"" according to a TikTok videothat has already generated more than 6 million views. The white woman with the unleashed dog, Denise Olin, was caught in the video hurling racially charged remarks during the Feb. 24 fight with her neighbor after the other woman, who was walking a leashed dog, asked Olin to put her dog on a leash. Los Angeles laws require dogs to be on a leash on public property and common areas of private property. Olin has since told The Times she regrets her comments. The two women, who appear to have a history of conflict, began recording each other during the encounter.  ""Let me educate you,"" says the woman recording the video, who is identified through her TikTok account only as Cindy. ""Let me educate you, go back to China,"" says Olin, who is also recording the incident on her phone. ""I don't want your dog to get hurt,"" Cindy says. When Cindy calls Olin a ""Karen,"" Olin responds, ""You're an Asian Karen."" At another point in the interaction, Olin repeatedly asks Cindy if she understands English. Olin claims in the video that Cindy once referred to her as a ""bitch"" and that the woman is the ""most hated woman on our block."" She also said the woman told Olin to go back to her country. Olin is Irish.   Cindy denies the claim and says Olin fabricated the story. ""Everybody hates you,"" Olin says. The incident took place on Butler Avenue in the upscale neighborhood of Sawtelle. Olin apologized for her words Thursday in a text message to The Times and said she has received death threats since the video was published on TikTok on Monday.  ""I'm devastated and receiving so many death threats,"" Olin texted. ""The police are involved. I'm so sorry for what I said. I reacted badly. It was our second altercation and she had said similar stuff to me. I had not filmed it. There was no excuse for what I said. I'm so remorseful. I'm not a racist just stupid."" Olin shared with The Times a voicemail she had received in which someone said they would have shot her in the face if she had made such comments to them. Cindy's video has 6.8 million views on TikTok. She could not immediately be reached.  ""I am Asian, but I am not from China,"" Cindy wrote on her TikTok post. ""I am an immigrant, but my family and I have been living in America for more than 20 years. This is our home. It deeply hurts me that there are still people out there making such racist remarks."" The video is reminiscent of a similar incident in New York in 2020 in which a woman called the police on a Black man in Central Park after he asked her to put her dog on a leash.  The woman, Amy Cooper, lost her job in the aftermath of that viral video. ""Over three years later, I am still in hiding. I am scared to be in public,"" Cooper wrote in an op-ed late last year.

"March 7, 2024","'Inside Out 2' Trailer: New Emotions Voiced by Paul Walter Hauser, Ayo Edebiri Enter Riley's Head",10,"  Disney and Pixar's Inside Out 2 has dropped another teaser trailer with three new animated characters voiced by Paul Walter Hauser, Ayo Edebiri and Adèle Exarchopoulos sharing main character Riley's (Kensington Tallman) now-teenage mind. Joining Amy Poehler as Joy, Phyllis Smith as Sadness and Lewis Black as Anger are Maya Hawke as Anxiety; Edebiri's new and perpetually jealous animated character Envy; Exarchopoulos' bored and eye-rolling Ennui emotion; and Hauser voicing his burly, yet red-faced, character of Embarrassment. The sequel also features new voices for fear and disgust, with Tony Hale replacing Bill Hader and Liza Lapira replacing Mindy Kaling, respectively. ""You got a real sweaty palm there, buddy,"" Riley, about to begin high school, tells a cowering Embarrassment after they shake hands. The trailer has other emotions in the head of the newly minted teenager in predictable turmoil as Lilimar Hernandez voices Valentina ""Val"" Ortiz, a high school hockey player everyone, including Riley and her friends, looks up to. Inside Out 2 Diane Lane and Kyle MacLachlan return to voice Riley's mom and dad; Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green and Grace Lu provide the voices for Riley's besties; and Yvette Nicole Brown voices Coach Roberts, who heads up a summer hockey camp. The voice cast also includes Sarayu Blue, Flea, Ron Funches, Dave Goelz, James Austin Johnson, Bobby Moynihan, Frank Oz, Paula Pell, Paula Poundstone, John Ratzenberger, Kendall Coyne Schofield, June Squibb, Kirk Thatcher and Yong Yea. Inside Out is considered a high-water mark for Pixar, whose original crowd-pleasing film in the franchise earned $857.6 million globally and featured a then-11-year-old Riley (Kaitlyn Dias) as she moved across the country with her family.

But in the wee hours one night, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, another compulsive swipe up on her phone screen led to a video from Mayan Lopez, the daughter of comedian George Lopez. The younger Lopez - also a comedian who, for years, had been estranged from her father - was clearing up some rumors about her parents divorce ... while twerking upside down. ""Mayan had inherited her father's comedy chops - she knew what was funny about her struggles and her pain and was able to poke fun at it,"" Wolfe says. Sure, OK. But if this was a scene from a mockumentary sitcom, the camera would zoom in on George, who is sitting next to Mayan and Wolfe, and is shaking his head like a proud but defeated father being reminded of his daughter's rump shaking. This isn't a Danny and D.J. Tanner-type family dynamic. But perhaps the father-daughter dysfunction in ""Lopez vs. Lopez"" may be more relatable and just as heartwarming and soothing. Created by Wolfe and the Lopez duo, the meta family comedy stars George and Mayan as fictional versions of themselves as they attempt to mend their fractured relationship. Their characters share their names, but not occupations: Mayan works at a veterinarian's office and George has a moving company, but it goes bankrupt, prompting George to move in with Mayan. It resembles what happened to their family in real life: When the pandemic hit, Mayan and her mother Ann, George's ex-wife who was also an executive producer on ""George Lopez,"" were worried about him - he is immunocompromised - so they came together during stay-at-home orders. And the healing began. The arguments and growing pains continue when the working-class family comedy returns for its 10-episode sophomore run Tuesday on NBC, airing back-to-back episodes beginning at 8 p.m. ET/PT.  From the show's set on NBC's famed Universal Studios lot, Wolfe joined George and Mayan to talk about being the only Latino-centered series on broadcast television right now, how George's relationship with alcohol is explored in the new season, and navigating boundaries when art imitates life. This conversation has been edited for clarity and length. InLatinoculture, you don't usually air dirty laundry about the family out in public. Mayan, what compelled you to do it? Mayan: I've been in therapy since I was very, very young. I like to think of comedy as tragedy and time. And just enough time has passed. During the pandemic, it was such a horrible time for everyone and everyone just wanted to connect. We weren't speaking very much at that time, but I was talking about my issues with my family and mental health and what having a father that wasn't really present [was like], how that affected my identity and how I integrated that into my comedy, and also the reconciliation. I think what helped sell the show was the numbers behind some of the videos and their success. My dad is immunocompromised; my mom donated a kidney to my dad 17 years ago. During that time where people were going apart, we came together. I did a whole series of ""Why do my divorced parents still act like they're married?"" The first one got 60 million views. Culturally, yeah, we don't air that stuff out. But that's part of some of the issues with our community is that the generational trauma and the machismo isn't addressed. I see ""Lopez vs. Lopez"" as a show for everyone, but also a love letter to our community. George, assomebodywhohas mined yourownlife for your comedy, could you understand why Mayan would do the same? George: I understand completely. Talking about my life wasn't going to be my process. In the early '90s, before Tim Allen got ""Home Improvement,"" he had a special on Showtime. I saw him right before he was going to do the pilot; he did like an hour and 15 minutes - it was brilliant. All that was in the show was in his act. I remember standing in the back room thinking, ""Man, I don't think I have anything like that."" Over the next 10 years, Dave Becky [a comedian manager] told me at Carolines in the early '90s: ""Your act doesn't really tell me anything about yourself."" I was trying to just be a comedian. Once I started to talk about my grandmother, Vicks, hot dog with a piece of sandwich bread wrapped around it - I mean all those kinds of jokes are what you see in memes now.  Was it a tough sell for you, the idea of doing a show with your daughter? George: I thought it was animation.  Debby: You did? For real? Mayan: He called me and was like, ""Is this going to be an animated 'Gilmore Girls'?"" Because he was like, ""There's no way that they're going to allow a real father and daughter to talk like that to each other.""  George: When you're orange, you can say anything.  Mayan: That was something that was very interesting, because there's no rule book; there's nothing that could prepare me to have a scene partner who's not only my father, but someone that's caused me pain, and I'm playing a version of myself. It's personal and it's about finding the right amount of separation to try to protect yourself, but also play the character to the best of their ability. We've both been very brave with this and I think that's also the comedic and the performer aspect that I've learned from him and seen growing up by seeing how he's gone into his art. My dad will take the script, and he'll rewrite it and it's more personal to our real-life experience and some things that come out in that script I've never heard from him.  Debby: Mayan saying how, in the show, they say things to each other that they haven't said to one another in real life - I think it's very powerful. I think it's been healing not only to them, personally, but also healing for the audience.    If this started with the TikTok videos of you, Mayan, trying to heal and process everything, what has it been like for you, George, doing this show with her? How has it been healing for you? George: I take responsibility, but also, I had a very difficult upbringing without a mother, without my father. In order to save yourself, you have to put a wall around your emotions - good and bad because I just don't even know what would happen if I didn't. I didn't react to many things, good or bad. I remember, when I was 7 years old, I signed up for Little League late and all the boys were picked. I went to the guy from the league, and he said, ""If I can find a team that needs somebody, I'll call you."" So he called me: ""I found a team for you. Aren't you excited? Let me hear you scream."" And I didn't know how to be excited. I was like, ""OK."" I couldn't. I was 7. But I understand it now.    Debby: George really surprised me with how sensitive he is. Just talking with you about your relationship with Mayan and everything, I've seen you in tears.  George: When we did, I think it was maybe a Christmas show, and I said to Selenis [Leyva, who plays George's ex-wife, Rosie on the series], ""I'm gonna say one line toward the end."" I didn't tell her what it was. But it was about me drinking. I said to her [Selenis]: ""You know, I'm not bad..."" I'm not bad. I've never seen a real, connected family in my family.    Mayan: As me, and my character, I have been able to see my dad as a person. Even through therapy, yes, I see that he's had this childhood and these things that have affected and changed who he is, and that's helped us and now we get to enjoy one another and, with this show, we're making up for lost time.  George: If Mayan and Debby were men, this show would not be what it is. The success of this show is that it was created by women who are emotional and vulnerable and know how to make you feel this connection with issues around family that everybody goes through. It's nothing unusual.  Debby, what do you remember about those early conversations with the two of them and deciding how to set this foundation for what the tone would be?   Debby: I actually talked to them separately. I wanted to get both sides of the story. They both had just such different perspectives. It's generational. He had these old-school ideas and Mayan is modern, Gen Z-like. She's very therapized and George is ... he's kind of therapized.  Mayan: He's gotten better. George: Hey, I don't hardly see you outside of here, so, I would say I'm much better.  Debby: They're still healing. They're still growing. It makes sense to me to that Mayan grew up on the set of the original ""George Lopez"" show, so it seems to make sense that they would heal on the set of a sitcom. It's full circle. Mayan, ahead of the first season, I asked if you and your father decided to make a pact that laid out some guidelines about working together. You said that you hadn't. George, looking back, do you think that was the right way to go? Do you wish you had laid out some terms? George: No, I know where the line is. But I remember, last year, we had a scene in the kitchen and Mayan says something like, ""Yeah, go ahead, for your daughter, the only one you have that we know of."" Then I said, in rehearsal, ""Is this real life? Or is this in the TV show?"" You could see her physical change. And I knew. But I'm very respectful of Mayan and how I speak to her and I leave her alone, I let her work, I don't go to her room or practice with her. I don't require that we say goodbye to each other at the end of the day if we're occupied with other things. We just leave. Professionally, that's the best way for it to work. Is there anything that surprised youMayanabout the process of working with your father? Mayan: Being raised by a stand-up [comedian] is a very unique upbringing, and you develop a thick skin pretty quickly. I think sometimes that could be pierced because of the material. But growing up, sometimes we would communicate through jokes. I think that translated to ""Lopez vs. Lopez"" because we're still bouncing off each other the way we'd always done through life. My poor mom - sometimes my dad and I would just rag on her and just have these bits, but we would make each other laugh all the time of just going back and forth. That wasn't foreign. When you really sit and think about her and what you wish you could tell her, is it hard not to be emotional? Is it easier to connect with her by riffing off one another? George: I think so. When I look at her when we're doing rehearsals and stuff, I see her as a 5-year-old girl, 7, 9. I can see her and [hear] things that she would have said to me as a kid in the car seat and all that stuff and still see her in this frame, but I look at her and see different Mayans through all of her life.  Debby, you're in a unique position in that the stars of your show are living the life that is on the screen. When you're around them, is it hard not totakenotes as they're interacting? Debby: I'm taking notes all the time. Sometimes they will get into it, and it can be awkward and Mayan will be like, ""Write it down, Debby!"" I'm just so blessed that they're so open. I can't imagine making a show with my father. Their dynamic feels very familiar to me, the laughter and the dysfunction. It's something that I experienced in my own life; my mom's an immigrant from El Salvador [and] my dad's a Jew from Miami. I grew up with this family with completely different points of view.    This season, things get meta when your characters begin working together. Why did you want to explore that and how much are you pulling from real life in the issues that arise? Debby: What we learned in the first season is the show really does live at home with the family. The vet [office] felt like a separate island. That's why we made that decision to have Mayan lose her job at the vet's office and work with George. We have a wealth of inspiration from the fact that they do work together to explore [and ask] what are those boundaries?    Mayan: The specific storyline, with Mayan and George through the first season, it was them really repairing [their relationship], and they're still repairing, but you get to see the fruits of that labor in the storyline this season. I think that's what we're doing. I actually got to teach Mayan [the character] something. But it's nice to see Mayan and George are looking out for each other and also Mayan being very protective of her dad's sobriety, and caring for him and wanting him to be happy.  George, you've been open about your relationship with alcohol. How did you feel about your character battling alcoholism in the show? Season 2 opens with your character being five weeks sober and still adjustingtoit. George: I think that it is a definite good thing to talk about because it has been a thing that's been present in my life for a long, long time - even though I don't drink as much as I did. Practically hardly anything. As difficult as I thought it would be [to have it in the show], I've actually enjoyed it. I'm an open book.  Debby: With the sobriety storyline - again, I'm growing and healing with this show. I started to confront my own issues with alcohol and overdoing it. I went for a long bout of sobriety last year, and our first episode back, when George is served a drink [at a restaurant] after five weeks sober, that actually happened to me. [In the scene, George orders a mocktail, but is served a drink with alcohol.] I had a breakdown because I was going through all the emotions of confronting how alcohol has been a bad presence in my life. But having George [the character] going through it, and getting sober, I really hope that inspires a lot of people, especially in our community, to confront it. We don't talk about it. The series is returning after theHollywoodstrikes. The industry has also been in the midst of contraction, and some of the casualties have beenLatino-centeredshows. Debby: If I thought about the tremendous amount of pressure it is to be ""one of the only"" or ""the only,"" it would cause me way too much anxiety. I can't control whether or not this show survives; all I can control is making the best show possible and putting all my energy and love into it and hope that it resonates with an audience, which it has been doing. We have this opportunity now and I'm focused on that: I'm training all the writers in the room to be showrunners. I take them with me through every step of the process, so that they can go out and pitch their Latino shows. We just need to get more. When we have the opportunity, it's important that we train the future. George: Look at how hard it is to have any show succeed; it's hard for everybody. But we [Latinos] get few opportunities. You see what [executives] prefer to use rather than looking like the world. You look at our show and it looks like what the world looks like. That's because of us. But also I know, because I've been in those rooms, they're not going to take a chance on a Latino lead. I remember Bob Iger said to me - he asked me to go to some meeting at ABC; this dog and pony show - and he says, ""George, how do we sell Hondas to Latinos?"" I said, ""You sell Hondas to everybody."" What do you want me to tell you? Make it La Honda? This is how you change things. You don't change things with ""I'm not going to buy that."" That doesn't work for us. You change it by creating, by not having an ax to grind. I don't have an ax to grind anymore.  Debby: Culturally, we're told a lot, ""You can't. You're not good enough."" We have to change our mind-set. We can. We manifest it.  This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"March 22, 2024","'Ned's Declassified' Stars Say They Were Not Referring to Drake Bell in TikTok Joke: ""We F***ed Up""",13,"  Ned's Declassified School Survivor's Guide stars Devon Werkheiser, Lindsey Shaw and Daniel Curtis Lee took to their podcast to express their regrets after a joke they seemingly made about Drake Bell received backlash earlier this week.  On Tuesday, the Nickelodeon child stars were on a TikTok Live during which they were receiving comments from fans asking what their thoughts were on the Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV docuseries, in which Bell came forward about his child sexual abuse.  While someone commented, asking about the docuseries, Werkheiser made a joke directed at Lee, saying, ""Daniel, we told you never to speak about that. Get back in your hole, Daniel, and give me your holes!"" Fans took that to mean they were mocking Bell following his claims.  Werkheiser attempted to correct himself in the video, noting, ""Sorry, we shouldn't joke about this. We really shouldn't. Our set was not like that,"" referring to the toxic behavior reported on Nickelodeon shows under the purview of producer Dan Schneider at the time.  After Bell calledthe actors out, Werkheiser shared an apology on X (formerly Twitter), writing that he was ""gutted"" he hurt his fellow Nickelodeon star. ""I was being an idiot today. No way around it,"" he added. ""I feel horrible that my dumbass was even speaking about this without seeing it.""  In this week's edition of Werkheiser, Shaw and Lee's podcast, Ned's Declassified Podcast Survival Guide, the actors addressed their comments further and the docuseries as a whole. At the start of the 45-minute video, Werkheiser explained that they hadn't seen the docuseries when they made the ""super shit"" joke.  ""Everyone was asking us for our opinions on it, and I get it. Now, having seen the documentary, it's so disturbing,"" he said. ""Now, we've watched it, and I get it. If I had just watched especially that third episode and then watched us joking like that ... I would be like, 'Are they sociopaths? Is something wrong with them?'"" Werkheiser also addressed Bell retweeting the TikTok video of them, where the actor-musician wrote, ""Ned's Declassless...this is wild...laugh it up guys...laugh it up...""Give me your h*les?!!"" Really?!"" The Bad Sister actor said he felt like a ""piece of shit"" after seeing that.  ""I know it looks like I'm laughing at this, and I fucking wasn't, but I know what it looks like, and that Drake saw it ... yeah,"" he said on the podcast episode. ""I just felt so fucking awful, knowing that Drake saw us in that context."" Later in the podcast, Shaw noted that, regardless of their not having gone through what other Nickelodeon child actors went through, they shouldn't have joked about it in any capacity and been insensitive to what everyone else struggled with.  ""I hate that this happened. I hate that we compounded any trauma around this situation that means so much to each of us,"" Shaw said. ""I am sorry. I know that that even when there wasn't an intention or malice behind things people have done for me, I know that it has just helped me when people meet me where I am and recognize like, 'Hey that was a gut punch, whether it was intentional or not.'""  Bell wasn't the only child star to come forward on Quiet on Set. Other actors, as well as crew and writers on The Amanda Show, Zoey 101, iCarly, Victorious and Sam & Cat, opened up in the four-part docuseries about abuse, sexism, racism and inappropriate behavior on the set of the shows, led by Schneider.  In a video exclusively obtained by THR, Schneider addressed the docuseries, noting that he ""could see the hurt in some people's eyes.""  ""It made me feel awful and regretful and sorry,"" he said. ""I wish I could go back, especially to those earlier years of my career, and bring the growth and the experience that I have now and just do a better job and never, ever feel like it was OK to be an asshole to anyone, ever.""

"March 18, 2024",'Palm Royale' Review: Kristen Wiig Leads Apple TV+'s Stylish and Starry but Substance-Challenged Satire,14,"  Apple TV+'s Palm Royale may be set in the late 1960s, but its greatest pleasures seem tailor-made for the age of the internet. Every shot of a socialite smirking over the rim of a cocktail glass plays like the perfect reaction GIF. The bitchy bon mots might as well be engineered for portioning into TikTok-sized soundbites, the outrageous plot twists for drawing gasps in the group chat. And the aesthetic - oh, the aesthetic! In a repudiation of the ""quiet luxury"" greige, this vision of America's elite is awash in shimmering jewel tones and Lilly Pulitzer brights. You could build entire mood boards around the hippie-chic bookstore or the baroque mansion. I myself lost a good 20 minutes Googling between episodes for cat-eye sunglasses just like the ones featured on Maxine (Kristen Wiig).  But the eye-popping style is as good as the show gets; the fun ends where the surface does. While there's plenty going on in Palm Royale, including back-stabbings, torrid affairs and attempted murders, there's precious little true substance lurking beneath its candy shell. At ten hour-long episodes, the comedy takes an awfully long way to get nowhere very interesting at all. Under the right golden light, though, even flaws can look like gleams of potential at first glance - and so it is with Palm Royale. If the tone of the premiere (directed by The Help helmer Tate Taylor) is all over the place, one might hope it stems from an excess of ambition; if the characters are hard to read, perhaps the fun will be in guessing what they're up to. Protagonist Maxine is, after all, an impostor: She's first spotted sneaking into a country club she cannot possibly afford, in clothes and jewelry she's ""borrowed"" from comatose grand dame Norma (Carol Burnett). But her real break into high society comes when she befriends Dinah (Leslie Bibb), who actually is the socialite that Maxine has only been pretending to be. From there, the Tennessee beauty queen gradually charms and manipulates her way into Palm Beach's ruling class, overseen by the imperious Evelyn (Allison Janney). As is surely obvious from the above paragraph, a huge part of Palm Royale's draw is its star-studded cast. And the actors certainly come to play: Wiig brings an off-kilter intensity to Maxine's Barbie-perfect looks and pageant-ready smiles, so that no matter how hard Maxine works to blend in she cannot help but stick out. Janney could play ""imposing matriarch"" in her sleep, but that makes it no less entertaining to watch her swan around in caftans while cutting Laura Dern's feminist Linda down to size. Bibb is such a blast playing catty and bratty that I wouldn't be surprised if her next lead role were cast off the strength of this one. And Ricky Martin, as snarky but secretly sweet bartender Robert, emerges as the closest thing this series has to a beating heart. If the performances are consistently entertaining, though, the writing is rarely up to their level. As created by Abe Sylvia (adapting Juliet McDaniel's Mr. & Mrs. American Pie), the story is vaguely framed as a takedown of the American dream - with Maxine as the striver climbing up the ladder through sheer moxie, and the Palm Royale members as the undeserving elite unable to deal with a changing world. But seeing that big picture requires zooming way out. Up close what's clear is only that the characters are a mess and their relationships a muddle. It's one thing for Maxine's frenemies to be unable to tell whether she's ""a country bumpkin or the most ruthless woman in Palm Beach""; the issue is that Palm Royale doesn't seem to know either. The narrative simply throws everything it can think of at the wall, and tries seeing what sticks. Sometimes it's a campy satire about Evelyn and Dinah exchanging passive-aggressive compliments. Sometimes it's an earnest drama about Maxine trying to find her place in the world, or Robert growing more confident in his sexuality. There are thriller elements, like gunshots and blackmail and secret identities, and absurdist ones, like a whale-centric subplot that might've been more at home in Wiig's Barb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar. Occasionally it gestures in the direction of social commentary, as TV reports of antiwar protests blare in the background and ladies at lunch mourn the ""death of gentility."" Mostly it operates on the level of a soap opera about who's screwing whom, who's inheriting what, whether Maxine will be able to pull together an end-of-season bash grand enough to cement her status in Palm Beach - which would be more engrossing if the characters were more than paper dolls bending to the whims of writers trying to fill an episode count. In a sense, it's appropriate that the one thing Palm Royale really nails is its look. Each set appears to have been decorated at great expense, in keeping with the characters' luxe tastes. Each gorgeous costume has been carefully chosen to signal each character's status or aspirations at a given time, such that it's often easier to track Maxine's fortunes through the appropriateness of her dresses than through the herky-jerky plotting. Our heroine would be the first to agree that presentation matters, whether one is trying to win a pageant crown, climb the social hierarchy or tell a story.  Eventually, however, even she loses the patience to put on a good face. In what should have been her greatest moment of triumph, she stands before a crowd in her most gorgeous dress yet to sing ""Is That All There Is?"" I wished I could ask the show the same.

On Tuesday, Werkheiser awkwardly joked about the abuse Bell suffered during a TikTok livestream with Ned's co-stars Lindsey Shaw, and Daniel Curtis Lee. In a video that has been subsequently posted to other social media platforms, Werkheiser jokes towards Lee who is off camera, ""Daniel, we told you never to speak about that.

Werkheiser adds: ""No, it's f***ing awful. The Drake Bell s***, that's crazy to hear. That is f***ed. And that never came out, which is really wild. Really wild.""

In the four-part docuseries Quiet on Set, Bell, the star of the Nickelodeon show Drake & Josh, reveals the extensive sexual abuse he suffered from the age of 15 at the hands of dialogue coach Brian Peck and also reveals he provided anonymous testimony that led to Peck's 2004 conviction for lewd conduct with a minor. The docuseries also outlined the allegations of abuse and workplace toxicity from multiple Nickelodeon former child stars, crew and writers that occurred on the sets of Schneider's many shows on the network.

"March 18, 2024",'Real Time With Bill Maher' Replays to Run in Primetime Saturdays on CNN,16,"  CNN is about to get a bigger dose of Real Time. The cable news channel will add a replay of the HBO series Real Time with Bill Maher to its Saturday lineup at 8 p.m. starting March 23, part of a larger strategic shift in how the channel will approach its weekend programming. ""The addition of Real Time With Bill Maher to CNN's weekend primetime lineup marks the start of a commitment and investment into topical entertainment programming that we're bringing to the weekends,"" said Amy Entelis, executive VP of talent, CNN Originals and creative development for CNN Worldwide. ""We've seen that audiences enjoy Bill's perspective and approach to news and information, and we're looking forward to the show now being on CNN."" The addition of Maher's HBO show (it will still debut on HBO and Max Friday nights, and will stream on Max) suggests that CNN wants a different style of programming on the weekends (at least on weekends where there is little breaking news). CNN has actually been televising Real Time Overtime, the bonus segment from Maher's show, Friday nights at 11:30 p.m. CNN has been televising Overtime for the past year, though it will stop doing so once Real Time moves to CNN later this month. Reruns of Real Time on CNN also serve as another example of Warner Bros. Discovery seeking ways to more efficiently monetize and window its content between its TV channels and Max. There is likely overlap (at least in terms of viewer interest) between the HBO series and the CNN audience, who may or may not pay for HBO or Max. Maher, of course, routinely books politicians and other newsmaking guests on his HBO show. He also occasionally makes news himself, as when The Hollywood Reporter reported that he had fired his team at CAA after being snubbed from an agency Oscars party in which Vice President Kamala Harris was in attendance. Earlier this month HBO renewed Real Time for two more seasons, keeping it on the channel's Friday night lineup through 2026.

"April 7, 2024",'Ripley' stars discuss la dolce vita gone sour; Dakota Fanning and Andrew Scott unpack their frenemy characters' motivations and our obsession with con artists,17,"  In early March, as the collective obsession it spawned was at its height, I had the chance to ask: Have Andrew Scott and Dakota Fanning seen the viral TikTok series ""Who TF Did I Marry?"" The actors were seated in a sparsely decorated holding room at a Hollywood screening venue where their new limited series, ""Ripley,"" was about to be previewed. Nearly seven decades after Patricia Highsmith's novel ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" first introduced the world to its titular grifter, Tom, the story of one of pop culture's most infamous pathological liars is now getting an eight-episode treatment on Netflix. And the 50-part social media saga by Reesa Teesa (real name Tareasa Johnson) about a walking red flag -- an ex-husband who allegedly made up family members, faked phone conversations and in their search for a home, duped her with fake bank statements that turned out to be screenshots from Google Images -- was further proof that stories of scammers and fraudsters never go out of style. ""Oh, my God, I know!"" Fanning said, her eyes wide with excitement. ""I wanted to watch that, but haven't. There are a lot of videos, right?"" ""What is this?"" Scott asked, curious to understand the enthusiasm. ""It's this woman who got scammed by her ex and made these videos where she is like filming in the bathroom or her car and telling the story,"" Fanning said. ""Oh, wow,"" Scott said, brows furrowed. The cunning con man who's brought them together has left a more lasting impression, inspiring the 1960 French film ""Purple Noon,"" the 1999 vehicle for Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law, and now ""Ripley."" Developed for television by Steven Zaillian (""The Night Of""), the series was originally set up at Showtime before moving to Netflix, with production spanning from summer 2021 to spring 2022. The lavish thriller, which is shot in black and white, stars Scott as the eponymous scam artist; Johnny Flynn (""Emma"") as Dickie Greenleaf, the wayward heir to a wealthy Manhattan dynasty with whom Ripley becomes obsessed; and Fanning as Marge Sherwood, Dickie's girlfriend, who is suspicious of the new man in town. The dark, subversive antihero saga begins as Tom is enlisted by Dickie's father, who mistakenly assumes Tom is a friend of his son, to venture to Italy to cajole him into returning home. Tom becomes infatuated with Dickie and his lifestyle, then kills him to avoid being deserted -- and the cover-up spirals from there. It's an apt parable for the social media age, in which the carefully crafted image can be seductive to a damaging degree. But Zaillian didn't embark on the adaptation with that in mind. ""It had nothing to do with now,"" Zaillian said by telephone. ""The big draw for me was to spend more time with this particular character. ... I think there's a lot of things about him that are like all of us. He has aspirations, he has envy, pride -- he might have more than we have, or he's just willing to go further to get it. I think one of the reasons that he's endured as a character so well over all these years, is because we do relate to him."" While Dickie is the person Tom becomes fascinated by, the dynamic between Tom and Marge brings the tension. ""Their relationship changes,"" Zaillian said. ""From the moment she meets him, Marge is suspicious of him. At a certain point, he appeals to her vanity. She starts to think, 'Well, maybe he is OK,' because, frankly, she's gonna get something out of it. And so it kind of goes back and forth. Her opinion on him constantly changes."" Scott and Fanning talked about their own experiences being duped, why we can't get enough of con artists, and climbing all the series' stairs. -- What do you think it is about con artists that audiences stay fascinated by? Scott: We talk so much about backstory when we're talking about characters and I sometimes think that's just mythical, because when you've got backstory about somebody, you have power. When you don't, [the character has] all the power. It's more sinister. Fanning: I think Tom Ripley is the original catfish. Also, what kind of separates it from other interpretations of con men, or whatever you want to call it, is you kind of get to see how he does it all, in pretty gripping detail. Sometimes some of those details are glossed over; in this, you're on that ride of how it's all done and I think that makes the particular character of Tom Ripley even scarier. Also, you start sympathizing with him. -- Scott: And you see his mistakes. Fanning: I should want him to get caught, but I don't. Scott: I was always like, ""I want to be able to feel what it's like to be him, not necessarily be a victim of his"" ... ""What would I do if I was him in these moments?"" -- ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" really asks the question, ""Is it better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody?"" And it grapples with the cost of buying into the life you're fed to believe is ideal. What did you find interesting in exploring the complexity of those themes against the social media era we live in? Scott: It's about somebody who's literally not being seen by a lot of people. Really just lives in the undergrowth. What I find moving about it is that I think he's got a great appreciation for all the stuff that Dickie Greenleaf just takes for granted. He's really brilliant at what he does. Dickie and, to a certain extent Marge, are not great artists, but they have that totally at their disposal. There's a theme of who gets access to the arts, and who is able to go to these beautiful locations and educate [themselves]. Tom, as he's doing all these extraordinary things, is actually falling in love with Italy, painting and food and clothes and just the beauty of the world. -- As an actor, your goal is to make an audience believe that you're somebody else and you will go to your own lengths to do that. Did it give you insight into what's driving Tom or how far he'll take it? Scott: He's not a natural-born killer. He's not going over there with any of this in mind. He's trying to survive. Fanning: Somebody approached him. Scott: Exactly. Somebody approached him. He didn't do anything. Then he caught some feelings. Then that happened. All these extraordinary places he goes to aren't because he's going, ""Oh, I always wanted to go to Venice."" He goes there because he has to. -- Maybe not to the extent of what we see in this series, but have you ever been duped? Fanning: The feeling that I hate the most is being tricked and duped -- even in small ways when you feel like everyone else knows something that you don't know. I hate that. It's awful. Scott: I will give you a specific example that happened to me last week. I arrived to Los Angeles. I was really jet-lagged, it was about 8 o'clock. I thought: OK, I'm going to go to the gym to keep me alive. And it's a well-known, good gym. Went to do my workout and put my stuff in the locker. When I finished and went to take a shower, I thought, I'm not gonna put my trainers into my locker; I'm only going to be in the shower for five minutes. I come out and someone had stolen my trainers! There's just one sock there. I was like, ""What the f--?"" You just feel so violated. And I'm thinking, ""I have to go home. My shoes are gone."" So I had to wear these extraordinarily massive flip-flops from the spa. I still can't believe someone stole my trainers and one sock. But it is a really weird feeling to be stolen from. I know you can be emotionally conned. I've experienced that before as well, with one of those bank fraud things. You do feel something has just been ripped from you. It's a horrible feeling. -- Tom is always paranoid about being watched. You both are public figures. Can you understand that paranoia? Fanning: It doesn't just have to do with being an actor or a celebrity anymore. I try and keep everything together. But there was one time that I was learning to drive and I was with my mom. We didn't have a destination; I was just practicing. And there was paparazzi following behind me every turn and watching me park. I finally got out of the car and I was like, ""I am trying to learn to drive. I am not going anywhere. You're going to be going up and down this hill all day."" He was very nice. One time, I was moving into my house and my garage and he -- it happened to be the same man -- was parked nearby and I was like, ""Please don't film me moving my personal items into my house."" But in general, I think now everybody worries about being surveilled in some way. -- Andrew, do you notice when it's happening to you? When someone has their phone positioned a certain way? Scott: Absolutely. And my real feeling about it is: just be better at it. Be better at disguising it! Not for anything to do with what my job is, just as a human being. It's the fact that you think I can't notice how obvious you are making it. Recently, I was on the tube in London, it was this relatively empty tube, and this girl [mimics person pointing phone in his direction] and she very badly took a photo and the flash went off. And I turned and was like, ""If you want a picture, please just ask me."" And she was like, ""I didn't take a picture of you."" Somebody from down the car was like, ""Mate, we saw it. You did. The flash went off."" So then she got up and got off at the stop. The shame. She was Tom Ripley! She was just lying to my face. -- I want to talk more about the Marge-and-Tom dynamic. Unlike the 1999 adaptation, where Marge is more warm and welcoming to Tom and wants him to fit in, in the series, like in the novel, she's skeptical of him from the start. How did you map out the pacing of her wariness? Fanning: The interesting thing about the novel and the scripts is that they're written from Tom's perspective. The other characters have to fill in a lot of blanks. At first, that felt overwhelming. But Steve's gift is his precision as a writer and as a director and the fact that he, whether it's what you want to hear or not, knows exactly what he's looking for and what he wants. I think my instinctual interpretation of Marge he was happy with, which was a relief to me. But we definitely played with it, like, ""Let's do a take where she doesn't believe him"" or ""Let's do one where she isn't so skeptical."" And then he would figure it out later -- what Marge knew, what Marge didn't know. It was a little bit of a puzzle of keeping track of the timeline of her skepticism. But I was thrilled to play a character, a woman, that wasn't completely duped. I love that this Marge is quite skeptical from the beginning and we got to have fun with that. -- They're very much a mirror of each other. Fanning: And her background is also not a privileged background. The jealousy of her is, ""You and I are alike, but you have it and I don't. And you don't deserve it still."" Scott: They see through each other. They're threatened by each other and you dislike about other people what you see in yourself. But I really believe that Tom loves Marge. I think it's too easy to think: ""Oh, he hates her."" I think he finds her inconvenient because she, of all people, might mess it up for him. And Dickie is a little bit more trusting or maybe just not as emotionally intelligent. Fanning: They're frenemies. -- Sexuality in Highsmith's novels is sort of up to interpretation sometimes; it's subtext. Andrew, what discussions did you have with Steven about how you wanted to approach that part of his identity? Scott: I suppose it was something that I thought about a lot myself; it was very important to me to not label him too much. I did have some brief conversations with Steve about that. ... We're very concerned with labeling in 2024. I feel like he's a character with a lot of secrets. And talking around it too much, I feel I've got to protect that character. I think you have to dramatize asking the questions rather than drowning the character in giving the easy answer to appease certain people's ideas. To my mind, he's a character who is Other. I feel like he wouldn't be comfortable in a gay bar; I feel like he wouldn't be comfortable in a straight bar. Sometimes I think his sexuality or sensuality comes out of his relationship with things -- art, clothes, props, music. I love the fact that we don't know. I think there's a lot of people who can relate to that. I enjoy the idea of pushing that -- for him to be flirtatious with a man; for him to be flirtatious with a woman -- and not diagnose him too much and not to impose too much of a sexuality. And I applied that to everything about him, not just his sexuality. He's the hero, but he's an unreliable hero. -- In the book, the three characters are very clearly telegraphed as being in their early to mid-20s, fresh out of college. How does a version of these characters who are somewhat closer to your age change your understanding of their behavior? Fanning: I didn't think about it. I feel like everyone is almost ageless in it. Obviously with Marge, you can tell she's somebody who is kind of bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and finds herself in this place and hasn't had a lot of experience. She's not a world traveler. This could be her first time out of the country. If I was thinking about age, I was thinking this is all still kind of new for her. Scott: It was a concern because, obviously, in the book, he's younger than I am. ... But that's not what [Highsmith] concerns herself with too much. Again, the sort of slipperiness of watching their behaviors and not caught up with: ""What's the age difference here?"" We're not playing something like the evolution of teenagers. That's not what the theme of it is and, so, it isn't really something that we thought about. Fanning: Steve didn't care, so we didn't care. -- Andrew, talk to me about the stairs. You had to endure a lot of stairs in the series. Fanning: Oh, God. Scott: There was a lot of stairs. We got a lot of coverage ... of a lot of stairs. I can't tell by the tone if he's really upset by the memory. Fanning: [ Laughs] No, he's not upset. It's just the truth. Scott: [ Laughs] It's just the truth. That's the thing -- it's very evocative because when you go [to Italy], you're going up lots of stairs. There's no choice. To see what it's like for a person from New York, who's experiencing this for the first time and has no money, and he's making mistakes, he can't speak the language. But yes, there's a lot of those stair scenes where he's got up and life is just tough. Steve isn't a one-and-done guy, so we certainly had a lot of takes with the stairs.

"March 2, 2024",'RuPaul's Drag Race' season 16 episode 9 recap: 'See You Next Wednesday',18,"  ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" season 16 continued on March 1 with the ninth episode in RuPaul's quest to find ""America's next drag superstar."" Previously in episode eight, Plane Jane joined Nymphia Wind and Plasma at the top of the tracking board with her second maxi challenge win in the iconic ""Snatch Game."" At the bottom was Morphine Love Dion who sadly had to send her sister Xunami Muse home in the Lip Sync for Your Life. This week, the remaining 8 queens get behind the sewing machine again for a Neo-Goth design challenge. Seated at the judges' dais for episode 9 titled ""See You Next Wednesday"" was Emmy winning host RuPaul Charles, longtime bestie Michelle Visage, recurring judge Carson Kressley, and Kaia Gerber as the extra special guest. The queens still vying for the crown are: Dawn, Mhi'ya Iman Le'Paige, Morphine Love Dion, Nymphia Wind, Plane Jane, Plasma, Q, and Sapphira Cristál. Check out our full recap of episode 9 below: It was tough for Morphine to wipe Xunami's lipstick message off the mirror because of how close they were before and during the filming of the show. She said that it feels like ""part of [her] is gone,"" but Jane was also feeling touched by the new bond that she had built with Xunami. Jane felt like it was a ""shocking elimination"" and that it in part ""overshadowed"" her win, but Sapphira and Mhi'ya were confused that Jane even won when they both expected Sapphira to be declared the champ of ""Snatch Game"" for her James Brown impersonation. Looking around the room, everyone believed that they're all tough competition and so at this point it will only take a small failure for any of them to be asked to pack their bags. The next day, Ru had another mini challenge for the girls to partake in. For this one she wanted them to ""spit take"" with the one making her laugh the most getting the win. After getting in to ""quick comedy drag,"" the girls had to hold a mouthful of water while Ru delivered a quick joke at them, at which point they'd splash the room with their ""spit take."" Ru was able to catch Q by joking that Jane is Miss Congeniality, telling Morphine she's pregnant, and Nymphia that they're redoing the ""Snatch Game."" Likely because she was actually caught off guard by Ru's joke, the winner of the mini challenge was Nymphia. For their next maxi challenge, Ru ""scared"" the queens with yet another design challenge where they'd have to create a Neo-Goth look from scratch for the runway. Available for their creations was a selection of black, white and grey fabrics in order to underscore that the focus is a goth fashion look. News of a third design challenge was music to the ears of seamstresses Nymphia, Q and Dawn, but frightening for Mhi'ya and Sapphira. Plane thought that Plasma should also be intimidated because goth is a style so far outside of her comfort zone, but Plasma was confident she could pull something off. Both Mhi'ya and Sapphira were planning to use silhouettes from existing garments in order to stay in their lane, but Q was worried that Sapphira was attempting to recreate something she's already done on the runway. Dawn and Q were getting competitive about their ideas for the challenge because they understood how within reach a win would be and so it was important to keep their cards close to their chests. Dawn noticed that Plasma was going back to what she's used to and advised her to make ""smart decisions"" by ""diversifying."" That thought sent Plasma on spiral to think about something completely different, but her idea to show more skin and do some shredded pieces began to feel very similar to what Jane was already creating for herself. Jane was concerned that in the last design challenge Plasma used the same fabric as her and it didn't turn out well for her so she should be concerned with repeating that situation. With half the day gone, Nymphia had focused all of her attention on creating a headpiece, but her mock-ups of a garment were not inspiring her. Jane was putting in a lot of work on her own idea only to realize that she might have bitten off more than she can chew with the amount of detailing she had incorporated. Sapphira took some time away from her work in order to give Plasma a pep talk because she could sense that she was getting in her head and the other girls' commentary was making it worse. Sapphira also made her rounds over to Mhi'ya's station to help her cut out the pattern for what she thought was a simple concept to execute. Dawn, Jane and Plasma were not pleased to see so much assistance going around the Werk Room, believing that at this stage of the competition everyone should be putting in their own work. The next day, Mhi'ya's energy and confidence was high, which struck most of the girls as odd because they all knew how much work Sapphira put in to Mhi'ya's garment. The other confident girls were Q, Nymphia and Dawn, but Nymphia didn't think that Q's look was goth enough despite being a beautiful piece. When they finally hit the runway on the Main Stage in the ""See You Next Wednesday"" category, the standouts were Jane's highly detailed strappy dominatrix-adjacent look, Morphine's velvet mermaid gown with spikes, Sapphira's presentation of her bored widow in a gown, Nymphia's oversized veil and lace dress, and Q's polka dot dress coat with a massive train. Plasma, Mhi'ya and Dawn's looks were a cut below the rest. After the presentations, Jane decided to hold on to her Immunity Potion for one more week before it expires. Ru accepted that and then announced that they'd all be critiqued this week. Carson thought Jane's look had ""great movement"" and Kaia appreciated that she ""sold the character,"" but Michelle thought it was ""not on [Jane's] same level."" Michelle questioned how Mhi'ya was able to make her tight-fitted dress without knowing how to sew, but it was unclear if anyone was buying it when she made it seem like she did most of it with minimal help from Sapphira. Michelle thought Dawn's dress was ""executed beautifully"" and Kaia was reminded of McQueen. The judges thought that Morphine's dead look makeup was beautiful, but Michelle thought her dress was ""basic"" and she wasn't ""blown away."" Michelle was also ""let down"" by Plasma's ""70s vibe"" look and was overall confused by what was going on. Ru agreed that it didn't read as goth. Carson called Sapphira's construction ""incredible"" and Ru appreciated the choice of fabric that she chose. Michelle called Nymphia's look ""a production of the most beautiful caliber"" and Kaia wanted it for herself. Carson called Q's look ""everything"" and ""more than enough."" Michelle and Kaia were impressed at how fashionable her look was and Ru called the construction ""exquisite."" Following further deliberation, Ru announced that Q was a cut above the rest as this week's winner. Jane, Dawn, Sapphira and Nymphia were all declared safe, leaving Mhi'ya, Plasma and Morphine among the bottoms of the week. In the three, Morphine was given safety and so Mhi'ya and Plasma had to face off in the LSFYL to ""Bloody Mary (Wednesday Dance TikTok Version)."" Mhi'ya jumped out of the gate quick with a surprise black petals wig reveal (to a cap!) and then produced two backflips down the runway in succession. Plasma did her best to keep up, but Mhi'ya kept turning tricks fluidly in beat with the music and stole the show start to finish. From the back, Jane thought that Plasma ""looked frazzled and frantic."" Once again, Mhi'ya confirmed the rumor that she's the lip sync assassin in the group and sent two-time challenge winner Plasma home with Ru's ""sashay away.""

"October 20, 2023","'Silent Walking' Is the New Hot Girl Walk - Here's Why It's Taking Over TikTok, According to Therapists",19,"  TikTok wellness trends come and go, and it's often questionable how much good they actually do. We're not here to hate on hot girl walks - it's more the obsession over ""clean"" eating-slash-living-slash-everything, detoxing every day (note: your body detoxes itself!), and idealizing the impossibly perfect morning routine (when simple ones work just as well). That said, some TikTok trends truly can make a positive impact on our health and wellbeing, and silent walking may just be one of them. Silent walks are basically what they sound like: going for a walk without any music, podcasts, or videos, unplugging as much as possible and being as mindful and in the moment as you can. It may not sound earth-shattering, but consider how plugged-in we are in our day-to-day lives. Many of us spend eight to nine hours (or more) staring at a screen, listening to music or podcasts, watching TV, and constantly keeping ourselves in a state of distraction. When that's your ""normal,"" completely unplugging for a 20-minute walk can feel like a revelation - and ""a breath of fresh air,"" says Ryan Sultán, MD, a board-certified psychiatrist and therapist and professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University. ""Silent walking allows for a mental decluttering, a space where one can be with their thoughts, observe the world around them, and engage in a form of moving meditation,"" Dr. Sultán tells SheKnows. ""In the chaos of modern living, finding finding moments of silence and mindfulness can profoundly impact mental health."" The trend appears to have started thanks to a now-deleted TikTok from creator Mady Maio. According to the New York Times, Maio's boyfriend actually encouraged her to try it, and it was an idea she initially scoffed at. ""My anxiety could never,"" she said. The first two minutes of Maio's silent walks felt like mental ""mayhem,"" she said, but eventually she entered a ""flow state"" where she thought up new ideas and found ""clarity,"" per the New York Post. ""The universe and your intuition comes to you through whispers, so if you're never alone with your thoughts and you never get quiet you're gonna miss the whispers,"" she said, ""and those whispers are the most important to be paying attention to."" It's a habit that Maio seems to have stuck to, noting in recent videosthat she still does 30-minute silent walks in the morning. The trend has since taken off across TikTok. It did gain its inevitable detractors (""Gen Z discovers walking!"" was a popular one), but many creators have found silent walking to be both a mental challenge and a much-needed form of reconnecting with themselves. ""It's a great example of how dependent I am on constant stimulation,"" said one creator, who struggled to quiet her thoughts. ""I'm so overstimulated,"" wrote another. ""The idea of going on a walk and just listening to my own thoughts has been ELITE."" @kenziethetexan trust me #fyp Real Love Baby - Father John Misty Experts are supporting the silent walking trend too. ""From a mental health perspective, this practice can be quite beneficial,"" says Dr. Sultán. ""Engaging in physical activity like walking already carries numerous mental health benefits, such as improving mood and reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression."" Add in the mindfulness that comes from disconnecting from your devices and you can enhance those benefits, Dr. Sultán goes on, ""aiding in stress reduction and promoting a sense of peace and calm."" Silent walking is ""essentially a form of active meditation,"" New York-based psychotherapist Kimberlin Shepard tells SheKnows, one that might suit people who struggle with seated meditation. ""A silent walk is active enough that it keeps you stimulated and offers outside distractions to keep the mind from wandering,"" Shepard explains. Plus, it helps you feel connected to something outside of yourself. ""If you take a walk outside, observe the trees around you, smile at a stranger, smell the fresh air, feel the cool fall breeze,"" she says. ""You are activating your senses, which stimulates your brain and allows you to be mindful."" Shepard says she's been recommending this practice to clients for some time now, and Dr. Sultán says he would ""absolutely"" do the same. ""Incorporating silent walking into one's routine can be a practical and accessible way to enhance mental well-being,"" he explains. ""It allows for a moment of pause, encouraging individuals to connect with their surroundings and their inner thoughts more authentically, fostering a sense of mindfulness that can be a protective factor against the stresses of everyday life."" If you're feeling increasingly stressed-out and disconnected from yourself, taking yourself on a 20- or 30-minute silent walk might be worth a try. While it's no substitute for professional mental health services like therapy, silent walking could be a valuable tool to add your mental health routine.

"March 20, 2024",'So Gross But So Good': This Dead Skin-Removing Foot Peel With 30K 5-Star Reviews Is Now Just $20 on Amazon,20,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. Maybe it's the ick factor. Or maybe it's the simple satisfaction of peeling off full layers of your own skin to reveal feet as smooth and baby soft as the day you were born. All I know is that Baby Foot has been an Amazon sensation for as long as it's been on my radar, which has been quite a while. And right now, the mega-popular exfoliation peel for rough, calloused feet is on sale for $5 off during Amazon's Big Spring Sale-the retailer'sPrime Day-esque event in March-which is on for just a few more days. Baby Foot Peel Mask Buy Now $20 There's a reason one customer called Baby Foot ""so gross but so good."" The foot mask soaks into your feet for one hour; you have to keep your feet wrapped up in plastic booties during the process. Afterward, you wash off the mask and it works like a chemical peel, sloughing off the dead skin on your soles and toes over the course of a week, much like a snake shedding its skin. ""This stuff is awesome and the skin peeling off part is secretly satisfying as all get out,"" one reviewer wrote. Baby Foot doesn't use any kind of harmful chemicals, though, to peel your feet away to silky smooth perfection. Instead, it uses 16 plant-based extracts, including lavender, orange, grapefruit, sage and chamomile. And no worries, there's no pain involved with the exfoliation process. No scrubbing either. It's the next best thing to magic - and way more satisfying than a pedicure, many shoppers swear. If Baby Foot sounds familiar, it's probably because this foot mask has been talked about practically everywhere. At least one person on TikTok documented the shocking process, which she called ""a game-changer"" in the video below. Trigger warning, though: it's gross!  @amalindacc Because I wanted baby feet! #footpeelingmask #feetcare #footmask #selfcare #callus original sound - Lin EvenBethenny Frankel has talked about going to a yoga class after forgetting she'd used Baby Foot, then being mortified at how her skin peeled off onto the mat. ""This actually IS magical!"" another happy soul wrote. ""My heels get thick, deep callouses that crack and bleed. I admit that I left these on my feet for 2 hours instead of 1. It didn't burn at all so I wondered if it'd even do anything. At all. After about 5 days, my feet started peeling just a little. After a few more days, I had to vacuum my bedside rug daily...My feet are literally baby soft...Still like a baby's butt. There's never been a pedi that did what this has done for me - and at half the price."" Another reviewer admitted, ""It's oddly satisfying to see the skin peel away, revealing baby soft feet underneath."" Get Baby Foot for just $20 right now and get your feet ready for sandal and flip flop weather stat.

"March 5, 2024",'The Sopranos' Booth From Finale Sells for Over $82K,22,"  A lucky Sopranos fan shelled out over $82,000 for the booth from Tony Soprano's last supper. The owners of Broomfield, NJ ice cream parlor Holsten's put the booth featured in the hit HBO series' 2007 finale up for auction last Wednesday, as the 88-year-old shop is being remodeled. After four days on eBay, the bidding war closed at $82,600 on Monday.  The winner doesn't just get the table and seats-for the hefty price, they receive the divider wall, which features a plaque that reads, ""This booth reserved for the Soprano family."" The tabletop jukebox used in the scene is unfortunately not included. Holsten's announced the auction on Instagram last week, writing, ""The time has come. All good things sometimes need an upgrade. The famous Sopranos booth is getting a much needed face-lift. We are auctioning off the well endeared booth on eBay starting today."" Holsten's owners noted in the post that they ""don't want to do this"" but ""the integrity of the booths are now compromised. They have been repaired many times and this furniture is over 60 years old. Obviously, we do not want to do this, however it has come to a point where they are structurally not safe anymore as a whole and we need to think about the safety of our patrons first."" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Holsten's (@holstensicecream) While speaking to the New York Post about the auction, owner Chris Carley said the parlor has become a frequently-visited location for Sopranos fans. ""We still have people coming in asking to sit in the Soprano booth. We still get bus tours on Saturday and on-location tours. Over the summer you'll see people taking pictures outside and people taking pictures of the booth,"" he said. ""It's not the frenzy it was when it happened 17 years ago, but it's still quite a popular attraction.""  The Sopranos series finale aired on June 10, 2007. In the scene filmed at Holsten's, Tony (James Gandolfini) goes to a diner with his family. As the locale's door opens and Tony looks up, the scene fades to black.

"April 10, 2024",18 acts we can't wait to see at Coachella 2024,23,"  With Coachella 2024 almost upon us, massive crowds are preparing themselves (and their selfie sticks) to catch headliners Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and Lana Del Rey and special guests No Doubt at the polo fields . But as always this isn't just about the biggest names on the poster, it's also about the cult favorites, rare performances and artists on the brink that continue to make these next two weekends in the desert something to brag about. Among the many artists on the bill during Weekends 1 and 2, here are 18 names we're excited to see. Sabrina Carpenter Come early for the Taylor Swift cameo-hunting, as she's rumored to be attending this year and (if true) would likely support her recent ""Eras"" tour opener. But stay to hear tracks from Carpenter's LP ""Emails I Can't Send,"" which was packed with thoughtful, expertly-sung pop in the spirit of former Coachella headliner Ariana Grande, but with a charm and relatability all her own. Stay even longer to catch a Barry Keoghan cameo. - August Brown Chappell Roan She killed it as the opening act on the first leg of Olivia Rodrigo's Guts world tour, where you could practically see her blowing 12-year-old minds with the raunchy and theatrical alt-pop jams from her 2023 debut, ""The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess,"" which she made with Rodrigo's go-to producer, Daniel Nigro. Now, Roan is moving on to what she calls ""the next chapter"" of her career with her brand-new single, the vaguely Eurythmics-ish ""Good Luck, Babe!"" - Mikael Wood Blur There's a definite KROQ-in-the-'90s vibe happening at Coachella this year and one of the best ways to time travel via alt rock is yelling ""Woo-hoo!"" with Damon Albarn and Blur as they play ""Song 2."" But what has given Blur the staying power beyond the '90s hits like ""Parklife,"" ""Girls & Boys,"" ""Coffee & TV,"" ""There's No Other Way"" and a dozen others is that the band consistently puts out really good music. Blur's most recent release, ""The Ballad of Darren,"" was one of the best rock albums of 2023. - Vanessa Franko Aquabats Anyone looking for a mixture of punk-meets-ska-meets-Saturday-morning-cartoons has one thing to say about the Aquabats' return to the polo fields: ""Super Rad!"" Any chance to see a band that reminds you not to take life or an ultra-hip music festival too seriously is worth carving out some time for. Even casual onlookers have to stop and watch the wacky band of spandex-wearing superheroes fight crime and giant inflatable monsters on stage between acts that are said to be the next big thing. As MC Bat Commander and company celebrate 30 years of playing shows, making TV shows and building an empire, it's a reminder that cool bands often have a shelf life but fun, weirdo bands can last forever. - Nate Jackson Bizarrap The Argentine DJ-producer's now 59-song-deep collaboration series has become the hottest tour stop in Latin music. He's booked stars like Peso Pluma and Rauw Alejandro, but his catalog's crown jewel will forever be #53, where a newly-single Shakira mercilessly strafed her ex over a sinister cub beat and entered the all-time diss track pantheon. It cracked the Billboard Top 10 singles chart, and made its producer a global star - he's got one hell of a contacts list of guests he might bring out for this set. - AB Tems ""Me & U"" was a high watermark for Afrobeats, one of the best songs of 2023 and a regal announcement of the Nigerian singer's own pop potential after she stole the show on Wizkid's ""Essence."" She kept up the pace with the lithe, riveting ""Not An Angel, "" and her forthcoming debut album will be a major event in global pop. Catch her up close while you still can in Indio. - AB Bicep The Northern Irish club music duo have long been underground favorites who thought like arena stars, packing their after-hours material with memorable sonic signatures and lacing their big-tent singles with care and complexity. Now they've built a dazzling AV stage show to match, and in the spirt of label mates Odesza and Bonobo, this could be the set that kicks them into a new tier of dance music's arena acts. - AB Victoria Monét After establishing herself behind the scenes as a songwriter for the likes of Ariana Grande, Fifth Harmony and Blackpink, Monét broke out big on her own last year with ""Jaguar II,"" a crafty, witty retro-soul record that led to her being named best new artist at February's Grammy Awards. Come for the slinky ""On My Own,"" about being ""so deep in my bag, like a grandma with a peppermint""; stay for ""I'm the One,"" in which she taunts an ex now unable to enjoy the sight of her ""riding horseback towards you, slow motion on a beach."" - MW Justice There's a universal truth that whenever Justice plays Coachella, an epic ""D.A.N.C.E."" party will follow. The French duo's first live show was at the fest in 2007, with a performance that may be second only to Daft Punk's iconic set for the biggest electronic moments of the fest. This is the electro house duo's fifth time at Coachella and it will mark the debut of a new live show for album ""Hyperdrama,"" due out April 26. Tame Impala's Kevin Parker has the potential for a guest spot since he's on the new single ""One Night/All Night."" - VF Reneé Rapp Can the algorithm even survive two high-intensity subcultures - lesbian TikTok and musical theater - thrust under one Coachella tent with the famously brash Rapp at the helm? Whatever happens in there, ""Snow Angel"" still rips. - AB Sublime ""Life is too short so love the one you got."" Chances are that if you're at Coachella you're adhering to one of the tenets of Long Beach's patron saints of reggae rock. In the '90s their blend of reggae with hip-hop and punk rock swagger created a unique lane amid the alt-FM airwaves. Though their style's been imitated ad nauseum to the point of spawning its own Cali Reggae subculture, none of the offshoots come close to the true passion that inspired Brad Nowell, Bud Gaugh and Eric Wilson to create a soulful, sun-soaked stoner sound all their own. With the late Nowell's son Jakob now taking up the mantle of Sublime (without Rome), the ability to recapture some of the band's original magic finally feels within reach. - NJ Khruangbin When people complain that Coachella isn't about the music anymore, point them to Khruangbin. Blurring the lines between psychedelic rock, funk, soul and surf rock, the Texas trio's mostly instrumental jams are best described as sonic comfort. The Coachella appearance comes on the heels of the release of new album ""A La Sala,"" but their previous two EPs, ""Texas Sun"" and ""Texas Moon"" featured Leon Bridges, who is playing Coachella's country sister event Stagecoach at the end of the month, so here's hoping he drops by. - VF Kevin Abstract The former Brockhampton frontman has long been a regular presence at Goldenvoice's festivals, including Coachella, where the hip-hop boy band played two of its final gigs (at least until the inevitable reunion) in 2022. Abstract arrives in the desert this year behind last fall's ""Blanket,"" a moody, guitar-oriented solo disc with heavy echoes of '90s-era alternative rock.-MW Brittany Howard Roots-rock fans know her from her roof-raising stint leading Alabama Shakes. But on her own Howard is much harder to classify: Her acclaimed sophomore solo LP, ""What Now,"" which came out in February, pulls from funk, soul, jazz, psychedelia and even classic house music as Howard uses her powerful voice to ponder the forces of conflict and liberation. Big Prince energy, in other words. - MW L'Impératrice No matter who is playing against L'Impératrice on Friday at Coachella, I recommend ditching them in favor of the French sextet with the snazzy stagewear. After seeing hundreds of Coachella sets over the years, L'Impératrice in 2022 is among the best. Get ready to groove to some French disco with a dash of yacht rock. The dance party was unmatched with songs like ""Peur des filles"" and ""Voodoo?"" but since the group just announced a new album, ""Pulsar,"" out in June, here's hoping we'll get a new song or two mixed into the set. - VF Deftones Are Deftones a complete mismatch with the typical hype beast Coachella vibes? Yes. Does that make their set in Indio even more fun to watch? Def-initely. The tortured wails of Chino Moreno combine with the band's chest-rattling wall of dissonance is destined to harsh the buzz of those who were just looking for a place to nap in between sets - unless you're a really heavy sleeper. Adding to the KROQ nostalgia machine working overtime at the fest this year, Deftones' one-of-a-kind aggression connects with sad and angry people of any age, whether you're a newly-initiated Zoomer or an OG Coachella head. - NJ Militarie Gun Even as Coachella has skewed to booking the biggest pop stars in the world in recent years, the nods to Goldenvoice's roots as a punk promoter are always on the lineup with a face-melting punk set or two. Following in the footsteps of Japandroids, Fidlar and Turnstile from previous Coachellas, I predict Militarie Gun is the one to watch this year. Plus, you probably already know the L.A. band's song ""Do It Faster"" from that Taco Bell commercial. - VF Taking Back Sunday Look, there's a point during every Coachella weekend where the whole thing gets a little overwhelming. This would be a good time to seek out the Taking Back Sunday set - which is fittingly on Sunday. Let all of the feelings flow through you with a cathartic scream-along led by the elder emos in attendance to the band's classics such as ""MakeDamnSure"" and ""Cute Without the 'E' (Cut from the Team)."" There should be some decent mosh pit action for this set, too. - VF This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times. Link to Image Graphic    INDIO, CALIF. - APR. 12, 2013.

"March 29, 2024",6 Reasons Why Moms Are Always So Tired & What You Can Do About It,27,"  There's no denying it: Being a mom is exhausting. Take the endless mental and physical tasks of parenting, add in disrupted sleep, then sprinkle on the normal stressors of work - and life - and you've got yourself a recipe for major fatigue. It's no wonder the hashtag #tiredmom has nearly 200 thousand posts on TikTok, and more than 600 thousand on Instagram.  But sometimes, exhaustion hits a whole new level. Although it's easy to brush off extreme tiredness as just a natural part of motherhood, feeling like you have zero energy left could be a sign that there's something deeper going on. And despite all the memes normalizing chronic fatigue, this is not something you should have to live with.  ""If we can make people feel better, give people energy, that improves their quality of life and however they choose to spend their time - with their children, in their career, whatever it is,"" says Dr. Meghan Rudder, a women's health specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. Just because you decided to become a parent doesn't mean you have to live in a fog until your kids grow up. When to get your fatigue checked out How can you tell when you're experiencing something more than the typical parenting-induced sleep deprivation?  Rudder suggests seeking out help as soon as you start to question whether there might be something else going on. ""Having a low threshold to reach out to someone is a good idea,"" she says. ""It can be hard to admit that you're tired, but I think it's good to talk it through with someone else who can ask more probing questions so that you get to underlying root causes."" If the first provider you see dismisses your fatigue as just a typical part of motherhood, get a second opinion.  Rudder says two red flags are 1. if you're far more tired than usual (without significant life changes that would explain the additional fatigue) and 2. if you're experiencing other concerning symptoms along with exhaustion, like shortness of breath, leg swelling, morning headaches, feeling extra hot or cold, or GI issues like constipation or diarrhea. Dr. Stephanie Liu, an assistant clinical professor in the department of family medicine at the University of Alberta, adds that fever, chest pain, or vision changes in addition to fatigue all warrant a visit to your doctor. Worst-case scenarios like cancer or occult infections are uncommon, but not unheard-of. It's not worth missing those diagnoses just because you're not sure that your fatigue is worthy of professional help.  Reasons you might have no energy Although this is by no means an exhaustive list, here are a few of the most common explanations for why you might constantly be feeling lethargic, even if you're getting decent sleep.  You're burned out Ongoing research suggests up to 14 percent of parents experience burnout-when you're not just fatigued, but emotionally spent, and even a good night's rest doesn't help you feel refreshed. Dr. Morgan Cutlip, author of Love Your Kids Without Losing Yourself, says that burnout includes cognitive issues like forgetfulness (or an intense version of ""mom brain""), and emotional dysregulation, which could mean losing your cool more often. There might also be a tendency to escape into distractions like shopping, social media, or drinking. ""What makes it hard to distinguish between burnout and normal motherhood stuff is that a lot of these are things we've normalized in motherhood,"" Cutlip says. But if it's constant, it's a problem, she warns. Among moms, this is sometimes called depleted mother syndrome. ""It's when our batteries are depleted,"" says Elizabeth Meyer, a clinical social worker in Massachusetts. ""There's nothing left to give, but then we still have to give more."" You're struggling with a sleep disorder Even if your kids are sleeping through the night, you might not be. Rudder says sleep apnea in particular is becoming more common among younger patients. This happens when your airflow stops periodically while you're asleep, and you end up waking up in the morning still feeling exhausted.  Your thyroid is out of whack Rudder says both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can cause fatigue. That's because the thyroid is responsible for releasing hormones into your bloodstream that regulate all kinds of bodily functions, and when it doesn't do that appropriately, it can affect your energy levels.  You're low in iron  ""I think a lot about anemia in this population, especially if the patient is still menstruating,"" Rudder says. Even if you're not anemic, low iron levels can still cause fatigue. Particularly during the early postpartum period, Liu suggests watching how many pads you're going through. ""If you are bleeding through more than one pad an hour or passing blood clots larger than the size of an egg, low iron from bleeding can be a cause of fatigue,"" she says.  You're experiencing post-viral fatigue If you've recently been sick, your body might still be recovering even though you otherwise feel better. Doctors often see patients struggle with lingering tiredness after a viral illness. ""That's something that can persist for a while,"" Rudder says.  You have a mood disorder  Both anxiety and depression can manifest as fatigue. ""It can be one of the initial presenting symptoms,"" Rudder says. Particularly during the postpartum phase when hormones rapidly drop, keep an eye out for low mood, lack of appetite or interest, or trouble bonding with your baby, Liu warns. How to get your energy back Even if there's nothing medical going on that's causing your fatigue, feeling drained on a daily basis is no way to live. Not only does it simply make, well, everything feel harder, Liu points out that it can affect how we connect with those closest to us. ""It can strain relationships with partners, family members, and friends, leading to feelings of isolation and loneliness,"" she says. It can even make it harder to bond with and care for our children. Although women are conditioned to give their all to their families - especially their kids - looking after your own health through small daily habits can go a long way to protect your energy: ""Eat a balanced diet, stay hydrated, go for walks outside - exposure to natural light and physical activity is beneficial,"" Liu says.  Cutlip recommends giving yourself ""microdoses"" of self-care, fitting it into your life in ways that work for you. ""We have to learn how to mother ourselves like we mother our kids,"" she says.  And don't be afraid to delegate. ""Women are socialized to give and care for others. And we haven't done a lot of teaching about how to recognize your own signals for overwhelm,"" Meyer says. She suggests figuring out what fills up your own cup, then asking for the help you need to make it happen, whether that's having your partner take care of the morning routine so you can sleep in sometimes, or having family members or a babysitter watch the kids so you can have a night out. Remember, she says, ""it's okay to have needs."" Before you go, shop our favorite sleep tools: More from SheKnows Over 42,900 5-Star Reviewers Say This Luxury Pillow Is 'Amazing' - 'Oh. My. God.

"November 10, 2023","6 TikTok Trends You Should Definitely Not Try on Your Vagina, According to an OB-GYN",28,"  From hot girl walks to VapoRub anxiety hacks, TikTok health trends have taken over the wellness space in the last few years, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Creators sharing their tips for mental health problems, trainers passing on their favorite workouts or stretches, and doctors providing information about common health problems can all help to educate audiences and destigmatize health issues. That said, the information given on TikTok isn't always the most accurate, which is concerning when these trends related to your body and health. All of that is especially true when it comes to vaginal health. It's no secret that vaginas and vulvas are a very sensitive area of the body, so when your FYP is full of vagina-related trends, it's worth approaching with caution. ""Inaccurate health information can mislead people and potentially harm their well-being,"" Mickey Karram, MD, a gynecologist and urogynecologist at VISTHETIC Surgery Institute and Medspa, tells POPSUGAR. That's true across the board, but once that misinformation hits an influential platform like TikTok, it can shoot to viral status - as many sexual health trends have. We talked to Dr. Karram about the most potentially harmful of these TikTok vaginal health trends, why you should avoid them, and what to do instead. Vaginal dabbing, aka vabbing Vaginal dabbing involves applying your own vaginal fluids to your pulse points (wrists, neck, inside of the elbows) like perfume. The idea is that your natural ""pheromones"" will help you attract partners or make a good first impression. And while you might think this sounds harmless (if a little... different), Dr. Karram says that's not exactly true. ""Vabbing is not entirely without risks,"" he says. ""Whenever an object or body part is introduced into the vagina, there is a potential risk of infection."" Sure, washing your hands before touching your vaginal area can help lower the risk, but you might still accidentally introduce bacteria to the vagina, Dr. Karram notes. ""Conversely, there's also the risk of transmitting bacteria, yeast, or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) from the vagina to the vabbing points on the body and, subsequently, to anything that encounters the skin."" Moisturizing melts On the opposite end of the spectrum, you might have seen some TikTok creators advertising ""moisturizing melts"" for your vagina, which are non-medicated vaginal suppositories meant to make your vagina taste or smell a certain way. Rule of thumb: anything that promises to make your vagina smell or taste more ""appealing"" should be a red flag. Though their language might disguise it, these brands are looking to turn a profit ""by preying on insecurities about vaginal odor,"" Dr. Karram says. In reality, the scent and taste of the vagina is ""natural and can vary from person to person,"" he explains, and you shouldn't feel pressured to change or ""improve"" that for anyone.  On top of that, ""attempting to alter the scent or taste of the vagina is generally unnecessary and can potentially be harmful,"" Dr. Karram notes. That's because your vagina relies on ""a delicate balance of bacteria and yeast"" to stay healthy, and introducing substances or attempting to change that natural pH balance ""can disrupt this delicate ecosystem and potentially lead to infections or other complications."" If you are concerned about the taste or smell of your vagina, talking your doctor is the best way to address it, whether it's a matter of hygiene or an untreated infection. Vaginal steaming According to Dr. Karram, vaginal steaming may be the most potentially harmful trend on this list. It's essentially a steam bath that's pointed directly at the vagina, which users claim can provide benefits like increased libido or a tighter vagina. However, vaginal steaming can increase your risk of vaginal infections, particularly if the equipment isn't properly cleaned. Pregnant women should also be sure to steer clear of vaginal steaming, as the ""excess heat from vaginal steaming can lead to complications and even birth defects,"" Dr. Karram explains. It's also important to note that your vagina is a self-cleaning organ. It doesn't need to be steamed to be clean and healthy! Overall, there's a ""lack of scientific evidence supporting the claimed benefits of vaginal steaming,"" Dr. Karram notes. Given the potential for burns and infections, it may cause more harm than good. Placing ice cubes in the vagina We got cold just typing that. According to this trend, placing ice cubes inside your vagina can ""tighten"" it and possibly treat bacterial overgrowth, but it's not something doctors would recommend.  For one thing, Dr. Karram says, ""the delicate tissues of the vagina are sensitive and can be easily irritated or injured by extreme temperatures."" Putting ice cubes in direct contact with these tissues ""can cause discomfort, pain, and even ice burns,"" he notes. And, as we've already talked about, introducing any kind of foreign object (including ice cubes) to the vagina can disrupt its natural bacterial balance, opening the door to infections. As Dr. Karram notes, this trend may not even work when it comes to ""tightening"" the vagina. ""There is no scientific evidence to support the claim that putting ice cubes in the vagina has any health benefits or can improve vaginal tightness or other concerns,"" he says. Lemon juice to delay period It's not clear where this particular myth got its start, but several TikTok videos have claimed that taking a shot of lemon juice can delay or shorten their menstrual cycle. However, there's no scientific evidence to back this up. ""The only reliable way to control or delay periods is through the use of hormonal birth control methods, such as the pill, patch, ring, or hormonal IUDs,"" Dr. Karram says. Boric acid suppositories for yeast infections Can boric acid suppositories help treat yeast infections? Some TikTokers think so, and this trend does actually have some truth to it. ""Boric acid suppositories have been suggested as a treatment option [for yeast infections],"" Dr. Karram notes, but adds that it's ""essential to understand the limitations and potential harms associated with its use."" Boric acid for vaginal use isn't well-regulated or researched, which means its effectiveness and safety aren't well-established, he says. These suppositories can also lead to skin irritation for some people, and can be toxic if ingested. ""Additionally, pregnant and breastfeeding individuals should avoid using boric acid due to the limited research on its safety in these situations,"" Dr. Karram says. If you do think you have a yeast infection, it's best to talk to a doctor about a treatment plan. Yeast infections are typically treated with antifungal medications (like pills, creams, or suppositories), which often clear up the infection within a few days to a week. Avoiding harmful TikTok vagina trends  It's getting harder and harder to differentiate between accurate and inaccurate information on TikTok, especially when it comes to health. Dr. Karram's advice? When you come across new TikTok trend that relates to your vagina or sexual health in general, it's ""best to always run things by your gynecologist and use good, common sense."" If your FYP serves up a tip or hack that sounds uncomfortable or just too good to be true, it probably is. When we're talking about an area as sensitive as your vulva and vagina, some healthy skepticism is always a good idea.

"March 22, 2024","A modern-day Forrest Gump: 'A Walking Testimony' visits Sonoma County on walk across America, tells locals 'you matter'",31,"  Mar. 22—For nearly 500 days, Florida native Kyndal Ray Edwards has been walking across the United States toting a ""You Matter"" sign, and spreading a message of mental health awareness. This week he made his way to Sonoma County and shared his story with local students and people in recovery. In a word, Edwards said in a phone call Thursday from a hotel that his trek down the Pacific Coast Highway, which will take him to the Golden Gate Bridge on March 30, has been ""epic."" ""I'm from a huge city, so we don't see stuff like this,"" Edwards said of west Sonoma County's rolling hills and small towns. ""Highway One has been insane. It's one of the most challenging yet rewarding roads that can be walked because every sight is just absolutely gorgeous."" Since leaving from his home in Jacksonville, Florida, on Jan. 1, 2022, Edwards has been trekking west, then south, as part of a journey he calls ""A Walking Testimony"" that will eventually take him to all four corners of the lower 48 states. Along the way he documents his journey on social media and speaks to people on the road and to groups and schools he connects with online. ""The main thing I do is share my story every single day, multiple times a day,"" he said. Before embarking on his walk, Edwards said he dealt with depression, drug use and a life of crime in Florida. After reading an article in 2013 about a University of South Florida student, Harrison Milanian, who walked across America to raise awareness about fitness, he became inspired to do the same, but continued drug use landed him a five-and-a-half-year prison sentence in 2015. During his incarceration, he said he finally turned his life around and is now nearly five years sober and over 4,600 miles into his walk, having crossed from Florida to the northwest corner of Washington. He's on his way to San Diego before returning to Florida and walking to Maine. While making his way through the North Bay, Edwards has seen Salt Point State Park, Fort Ross, Valley Ford, Bodega Bay and the famous schoolhouse from ""The Birds"" in the town of Bodega. He also stopped at the Olympia House Rehab center in Petaluma on Wednesday to speak to staff and clients and spoke to students at a Tomales elementary school Thursday. At the center of his message is that ""You Matter."" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kyndal Ray (@a_walking_testimony) ""I tell people that they are loved and they have value and purpose and they matter,"" Edwards said. ""And I tell people that when it comes to recovery, a support system is amazing, but none of it is going to work unless you want it to work. Recovery is hard if you don't have good mental health, that's the center of everything if you ask me."" Throughout his two-year journey, Edwards has faced setbacks, including hernia surgery and challenges like a walk through the Rocky Mountains in winter, but said his self-determination to complete his goal keeps him on the road. ""I thrive off of accomplishments after giving myself a goal, especially a challenging goal,"" he said. ""That stretch from Leggett (in Mendocino County) to the coast was one of the hardest days on my journey. I did 1,900 feet of elevation climbing on winding roads with semis coming at me all day. At the end of it, I was jumping around ecstatic because I had completed something super challenging."" Edwards funds his journey by selling ""A Walking Testimony"" merchandise online and accepts donations and lodging from the 44,000 people who follow him on TikTok and other social media platforms. He said people he meets every day keep him motivated to keep walking, from those who see his ""You Matter"" sign and stop to talk, to those who share their own stories of dealing with addiction or depression. This device is unable to display framed content. Click here to view this embed. ""Almost 90% of comments (on social media) are somebody saying how much of an inspiration this journey is or what this journey is doing for them, it's stuff like that that keeps me going,"" he said. In addition to following his walk on social media, Edwards encourages people to share his message and advocate for mental health and addiction recovery in their own ways. He also invites those who want to walk with him to join him on March 30 for his trip across the Golden Gate Bridge. The day will mark his 31st birthday and his 500th day of walking. Edwards will begin his walk from the Sausalito side at 1 p.m., holding his ""You Matter"" sign, and will then make his way through the city. ""Anybody that can see the sign, we just want them to know that they matter,"" he said.

"March 29, 2024","A TikTok ban is a long way off -- and not what we need; As U.S. lawmakers try to force a sale of the app, where are the bigger protections for our data?",32,"  The House of Representatives passed a bipartisan bill this month threatening to ban TikTok unless its parent company ByteDance sells the app. It may take the Senate months to address the legislation, which faces some opposition, so a ban is not imminent. But the relative success of this approach highlights the narrow, problematic pathway for data security reform in the U.S. as we continue to avoid real oversight. The authors of the House bill focused on national security, emphasizing concerns about the Chinese government's access to the data of U.S. citizens who use TikTok. Although dialing up national security concerns was an effective tactic to marshal some consensus, that strategy still may not pass the legislation -- and it won't address the many security concerns that dog tech companies beyond TikTok. The U.S. uses a so-called risk-based approach to tech oversight, which addresses problems only after they have already developed. By contrast, Japan and some European countries use a precautionary approach that tries to anticipate risks. Tech firms have flourished financially under the U.S. approach: Companies can gather, use and monetize data with few constraints. In theory, such freewheeling innovation presented only limited national security risks as long as the U.S. was the dominant global tech player, competing with allies and partners. But China and wildly influential apps such as TikTok expose how that approach created a regulatory vacuum that affects consumer safety. TikTok might be less concerning if our federal lawmakers had to date taken comprehensive action to protect consumer data. Instead of pursuing that broader goal, with its recent act the House targets ByteDance as a foreign policy threat and offers frameworks to designate other ""foreign adversary controlled applications."" Perhaps most troubling, the bill extends these considerations to persons deemed ""subject to the direction or control of a foreign person or entity"" without specifying what form such influence might take. This would create a highly subjective system that encourages targeting based on national origin and passports -- not the type of policy that attracts and retains the best and brightest international talent during an era of extreme competition for technical skills. That is to say nothing of the message that it sends to people in the U.S. who have been rocked by increases in anti-Asian discrimination and the Department of Justice's China Initiative, which ended because of its controversial broad scrutiny of Chinese academics but which some lawmakers have sought to revive. A common sense alternative would be to create guardrails that apply to all firms operating in the U.S. That would honor Congress' mandate to regulate commerce among states that currently have widely varying laws governing data. It would also allow the U.S. to better align with its global democratic allies and partners, most of which already have comprehensive data security protections for their citizens. Indeed, though China allows alarmingly broad government access to data, it is ahead of the U.S. on protecting consumer data from corporations. For example, China's Personal Information Protection Law largely aligns with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, with both measures tackling corporate handling of personal information. Action from the U.S. president and Congress is necessary but not sufficient. A complementary strategy in the private sector would be creating metrics to rate companies based on their data security to help investors consider these issues in stock valuation, much like metrics tracking corporate environmental practices. Another possibility is industry standards for data security, comparable to Energy Star ratings that tell consumers a product is energy efficient. From both the private and public sectors, there should be more funding for data security education through schools and libraries to teach children and adults how to think more critically about the use of their data. To counter the grip that online life has on many users, we also need greater investments for in-person communities, which can strengthen offline advocacy for consumer interests. The House bill is not what we need. If the flood of calls from TikTok and its users to congressional offices is any indication, it's also not what many want.

"January 26, 2024",A Viral TikTok Has Its Gen-Z Creator in Major Hot Water With 'Hostile Women',33,"  Like most everybody else, I had a lot of opinions about parenting before I became a parent. I was never gonna let my kid do this; my kid would never act like that. So when I actually had kids, I was knocked swiftly and painfully off that parenting pedestal because - surprise! - it's a whole lot harder in practice than it is in theory. Thankfully, I grew up in a time before social media, when I didn't have an internet soapbox from which to express those garbage opinions to the general public. But unfortunately that isn't the case for Emma, a fresh-faced and childless TikTok-er in her early 20s who is blowing up for all the wrong reasons: namely, her (suuuuper-unpopular) hot take on the cost of childcare. It all started a week ago, when Emma posted a response video to another TikTok in which a millennial mom was saying that millennials can't afford to have children: an opinion which, according to Emma, highlights the problem with ""This whole mindset that really permeates our society that makes people think they can't have kids when, really, they can.""  ""She's taking into account things like childcare,"" Emma (one of 11 children who were raised in a two-parent household by a stay-at-home-mom) opined in her video, before launching headfirst into hot water by following up with, ""You only need childcare if you're prioritizing your career."" *cue record scratch sounds* Hmm ... so if you just prioritize your children instead of your career, you can have all the kids you want and financial stability? Got it. She advises that if we'd just save a little money by doing things like shopping for our kids at cheaper places, we could afford to stay home with them. On Sept. 30, the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) is set to expire, leaving many parents who rely on child care in the lurch. https://t.co/dnqSpQhZtt - SheKnows (@SheKnows) September 25, 2023 Predictably, TikTok has had a field day with this, yielding not only over 15K comments, but also a ton of videos in response - ranging from outright roasting Emma to lamenting her naivety.  ""This entire video is privileged and tone deaf. Sincerely, a millennial mom of 5 kids,"" said one commenter. ""Emma, have kids in this economy & circle back, sis,"" wrote another. And then there was the simple ""Bless your heart,"" which, if you're familiar with the phrase, isn't actually all that much of a blessing. Then there were the response videos. Some are hilarious, like user @kait_hh, a tired-looking mom on a couch who yells to her partner offscreen, ""Babe! Babe, a 22-year-old on TikTok figured it out. We just have to stop making our career a priority, and then we can pay our bills.""  Some were more empathetic toward Emma's ... ahem, misdirection, offering words of wisdom, like user @beingbecki_. ""You need your ass handed to you sometimes,"" she said gently. ""You need it to happen to grow, and to learn. You need to be embarrassed; you need to be told that you're wrong. ... I hope at 22 you can realize that there are so many more experiences beyond your own, and that you can take this and learn from it."" Out of all of these, though, my personal favorite commentary on the Emma debacle is a compassionate take from @thisisitTV.  ""Emma's parents did their job,"" says Cheldin Barlatt Rumer, owner of the account. ""And what I mean by that is, Emma's parents made sure that she didn't know what it took to raise 10 children. ... Emma's parents allowed her to believe that it was simply just making better choices."" Barlatt Rumer went on to point out that this is pretty much what every parent tries to do. ""As a parent what we do is we make sure you are unaware of the difficulties. That you do not see it. You do not hear it. You do not feel it,"" she said. ""Emma's parents made sure that she felt seen and heard, but didn't see and hear everything. And that's what we are trying to do. ... This post is simply just to celebrate all the parents out there that are making sure that their children are protected from the stress of raising them, of providing for them, of being there for them."" (See her TikTok here.) So true! We parents go to great lengths to make our kids feel happy and loved - even if that sometimes (lots of times?!) means sacrifices on our part. And Emma's statements, as inflammatory as they feel to many of us, were most likely coming from a combination of youthful, kid-less inexperience, and the result of an upbringing where she was protected from the sometimes-harsh realities that come along with raising kids. Unfortunately, Emma posted a follow-up video that was less of an apology and more of a doubling-down on her original statements, lambasting the ""hostile women"" responding to the original video. The hateful commentary, she insists, ""really says a lot more about the opposing viewpoint than it does about my take.""  Sigh. Hostile or compassionate, it appears that none of the feedback she's received is sinking in - but as parents know, she'll find out for herself sooner or later. As one of the comments on her follow-up video says: ""Life has a way of humbling any of us. Once that happens you will have more grace for everyone.""

"March 17, 2024",Abcarian: Flamin' Hot Cheetos and iPhones are ruining my kid and yours,34,"  With apologies to Allen Ginsberg: I am seeing the best minds of our middle-school generation destroyed by Flamin' Hot Cheetos and iPhones,  Teenagers on the cusp of young adulthood dragging themselves out of bed each day to mainline TikTok and Snapchat,  Measuring themselves by the yardstick of uber-filtered Kardashian perfection and falling short, Gettingexpelled from schoolfor sending AI-generated naked photos of classmates. I want to howl about what's happening to our kids. Between the negative brain effects of ultra-processed foods, and what can only be described as smartphone use disorder, something has gone terribly awry. As it happens, you've caught me at a bad moment. In our home lately, the 13-year-old and I seem to be having daily conflicts over food and phones. When she moved in with me at age 8, she had a smartphone, which I immediately put away. Her preference for ultra-processed food was already well-established; she'd been raised on a diet heavy on fast food and Lunchables. We very consciously waited until eighth grade to get her an iPhone, as recommended by many childhood experts, but I honestly don't think we waited long enough. Her first, non-smart phone allowed her to take pictures, make calls and text, but had no internet functions. In my view, it was perfect. In hers, an embarrassment. When her iPhone arrived at the beginning of this school year, everything changed. Although we made a contract outlining the rules, her phone was never out of sight. Even when it was supposed to be put away, surreptitious use continued - in the classroom and at the dinner table. It became an appendage. Taking away the phone as a consequence of breaking the rules, a stipulation in our contract, resulted in meltdowns. How are young teenagers supposed to regulate their phone use when they haven't yet figured out how to regulate their moods or relationships? Giving a kid a smartphone is like putting a bomb in their hands and hoping it never goes off. I am worn down trying to monitor my niece's phone behavior and making sure she consumes a diet that will not turn her into a diabetic teenager. (No, I am not fat shaming anyone! I am pointing out that there is a relationship between the quality of food we eat, what we drink and the state of our health.) On Monday, I opened the Wall Street Journal to find a story with an illustration of a human brain made entirely of Cheetos. They should have added an image of what your kids' hands look like after consuming a bag of them. Or your furniture. ""Ultra-processed foods may not only affect our bodies,"" the story began, ""but our brains too. New research suggests links between ultra-processed foods - such as chips, many cereals and most packaged snacks at the grocery store - and changes in the way we learn, remember and feel."" Because the foods mimic other addictive substances, the story said, ""some scientists are proposing a new mental-health condition called 'ultra-processed food disorder.' "" And so I give thanks to California lawmakers for being willing to consider a bill that would banfrom public schools foods that contain artificial dyes that have been linked to brain changes. No one is suggesting that all these foods should be banned for everyone, all the time; only that, like sugary sodas, they should not be on offer or for sale at school during school hours.  Each weekday morning, I drop off my niece at school and watch as nearly every kid shuffles along, head down, eyes focused not on the world around them, but on their smartphones. They cross the street looking at their smartphones. They stand in clumps looking at their smartphones. When I pick her up in the afternoon, same thing. Last week in the Atlantic, Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University's Stern School of Business proposed that smartphones have changed the very nature of childhood -and not for the better. ""What is childhood - including adolescence - and how did it change when smartphones moved to the center of it?"" Haidt asks. ""If we take a more holistic view of what childhood is and what young children, tweens, and teens need to do to mature into competent adults, the picture becomes much clearer. Smartphone-based life, it turns out, alters or interferes with a great number of developmental processes."" Among them, he writes, kids spend less time playing with each other, less time taking physical risks (like climbing trees!), less time interacting face to face, less time learning from real-time conversational cues and less time learning how to resolve conflict (why do that when you can just block your antagonist?). He suggests that the psychological development of children born in and after 1996 has been ""fundamentally altered"" by the ubiquity of smartphones. ""Synchronous interactions make us feel closer to the other person because that's what getting 'in sync' does,"" he writes. ""Texts, posts, and many other virtual interactions lack synchrony. There is less real laughter, more room for misinterpretation, and more stress after a comment that gets no immediate response."" Add to that the insecurities inherent in an adolescent's budding sexuality, or the indescribably mean way middle-school girls can behave with one another, plus the availability of online porn and you have a social nightmare on your hands. ""My claim,"" writes Haidt, ""is that the new phone-based childhood that took shape roughly 12 years ago is making young people sick and blocking their progress to flourishing in adulthood. We need a dramatic cultural correction, and we need it now."" He proposes four simple correctives that wouldn't cost a penny: No smartphones before high school. No social media before 16. Phone-free schools. More independence, free play and responsibility in the real world. How I wish it were as easy as writing down such commonsense rules, or even passing a law.  @robinkabcarian This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

Finding the perfect foundationcan be a frustrating (and sometimes expensive experience). It can be too cakey, ends up highlighting your flaws rather than airbrushingthem, and then later come off your face in hours. Well, TikTok helped thousands of people find a foundation that's worth adding to your cart - and it's budget-friendly.  You've probably seen the Maybelline FitMe Matte + Poreless Foundation on drugstore shelves over the years, and this classic is absolutely worth it, according to TikTokbeauty gurus. And if you need another reason to buy it, Adriana Lima adores the brand, and even used this foundation to achieve her Met Gala look in 2017, per New Beauty. The FitMe foundation usually goes for $6 (a true steal!), and there are more than 35 shades to browse, so you'll be able to find the right shade for your skin tone. The shades vary in price, so there's a chance your discount might not be as steep as others, but you'll still get a deal. Image: Maybelline. Buy: Maybelline Fit Me Matte + Poreless Liquid Foundation Makeup $7, originally $7.99 And if you're skeptical of TikTok reviewers, Amazon buyers are also a big fan of this liquid foundation. With more than 157,000 ratings and 4.5 stars, this is one of the most beloved foundations on all of Amazon. ""I've been using this foundation for a little over a year now, and I absolutely love it,"" An Amazon reviewer wrote. ""It provides a natural, full coverage, and you only need to apply a small amount. I have oily, sensitive skin, and this has never caused me to break out even if I leave it on for an evening workout session."" Another shopper said they found their ""perfect color match,"" after using this, saying, ""For me this is the only foundation (since high school 10+ years of use) with a perfect color match... This is the most reliable, long wear and safe foundation I've ever owned for my skin. I never have to worry about breaking out (combination/oily skin)."" ""Paired this foundation with elf putty primer and it works like a dream. I have combination skin and this gives me a smooth surface to work with. Lasts a good 10-12 hours,"" another Amazon shopper gushed. This oil-free foundation blurs pores, while providing all-day coverage. Reviewers recommend using a silicone-based primer with this foundation and setting it with loose powder.

"March 18, 2024",Adult MAGA rage is making schools more dangerous for students,36,"  Link to Image Last week saw national headlines regarding two tragic stories that illustrate how MAGA radicalization of adults endangers kids in school. First, a medical examiner reported that Nex Benedict, the non-binary Oklahoma 10th-grader who passed away recently after enduring a beating in a school bathroom, apparently died by suicide. Then, James Crumbley, the father of Michigan school shooter Ethan Crumbley, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for providinghis disturbed son with a gun. The boy's mother, Jennifer Crumbley, was convicted of the same crime in February.  What links these stories is that they are both case studies in how the hatreds and obsessions of MAGA adults are trickling down into the lives of children, and causing real harm and even death. The Crumbleys faced such unusual charges because they gave their son access to guns mere days before the 2021 shooting, despite knowing he was articulating violent fantasies. One could guess right-wing politics were a factor, but there's no need to speculate. In 2016, Jennifer Crumbley wrote a gushing open letter praising Donald Trump as a man of ""sincerity, and humility"" who she trusted with ""my son's future."" She claimed children of immigrants get ""free tutors, free tablets from our Government,"" while her son supposedly gets nothing.  Benedict died in the wake of a growing crescendo of right-wing hysterics demonizing LGBTQ students and teachers as ""groomers"" and accusing them of being a threat to other students. In Oklahoma, the far-right Republican state superintendent, Ryan Walters, has been especially aggressive on culture war issues, attacking LGBTQ people and calling for book bans. In an especially trollish move, Walters recently hired Chaya Raichik, who runs the infamous ""Libs of TikTok"" Twitter account, to be on the state's library committee. Raichick's only ""experience"" in education is targeting LGBTQ teachers and allies with her account, knowing bomb threats and harassment usually follow. Benedict was beaten up in a girls' bathroom, after being required by Oklahoma state law to use a restroom based on gender assigned at birth, not the one they live as.  Want more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Subscribe to her newsletter Standing Room Only. Raichik, Walters, and other MAGA Republicans are scrambling to deny any link between Benedict getting beaten up in a bathroom and a suicide that literally happened the next day. Benedict's family disagrees, however, noting the ""severity of the assault"" as shown by the autopsy. President Joe Biden released a statement declaring, ""no one should face the bullying that Nex did"" and they ""should still be here with us today."" Walters, in response to the criticism, leveled baseless accusations implying LGBTQ people are pedophiles.  In Oklahoma we will not be taking advice from someone who is actively indoctrinating kids. https://t.co/gPcG6eIjvK - Superintendent Ryan Walters (@RyanWaltersSupt) March 12, 2024 This doubling down on the MAGA vitriol that is linked to school violence is not unique to Walters, but swiftly becoming endemic to the Republican Party. That's evident in the growing popularity of Raichik as a conservative leader, even though she regularly proves she is incapable of coherent sentenceswhen asked to explain what she believes. Even more determinative, from a pure numbers perspective, was the North Carolina primary this month. Republicans nominated far-right activist Michele Morrow for state superintendent, despite - or because of - her history of shockingly violent rhetoric. Unlike the current Republican incumbent, Catherine Truitt, Morrow has no experience in education. On the contrary, Morrow hates public schools, calling them ""socialism centers"" and ""indoctrination centers"" and homeschooling her kids instead. But, in a sign of how radical the GOP has become, this is the least incendiary aspect of Morrow's campaign. As CNN reported, Morrow has a long-standing habit of calling for the violent deaths of Democrats or anyone she perceives as ""liberal.""  In other comments on social media between 2019 and 2021 reviewed by CNN's KFile, Morrow made disturbing suggestions about executing prominent Democrats for treason, including Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Hillary Clinton, Sen. Chuck Schumer and other prominent people such as Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates. She wants Obama to be killed by ""firing squad,"" and called for it to be aired on ""Pay Per View."" She also longed for Obama to be executed by electric chair. In response to President Joe Biden asking Americans to temporarily wear a mask to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Morrow wrote, ""KILL all TRAITORS!!!"" She also called for the imprisonment of Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp for refusing to help Donald Trump steal the 2020 election.  On Wednesday, the Washington Post reported, ""School hate crimes targeting LGBTQ+ people have sharply risen in recent years, climbing fastest in states that have passed laws restricting LGBTQ student rights and education."" Overall, the annual reported hate crimes doubled from what they were just a few years ago. In the ""states with restrictive laws, the number of hate crimes on K-12 campuses has more than quadrupled"" since Raichik and her Republican cronies in states like Florida and Oklahoma got to work.  In the wake of Benedict's death, we're hearing a lot of Republicans, even the most rabidly MAGA ones, claim they oppose violence in schools, even against queer kids. Actions like elevating Morrow, Raichik and Walters say otherwise. At this point, it's almost banal to point out that the Republicans who claim to be ""protecting"" kids do not actually care how many children are hurt - or killed - because of their cynical efforts to generate right-wing panics and culture wars. But it's crucial nonetheless to keep talking about this. That the MAGA movement stokes violence hardly needs arguing, as evidenced by January 6. It was inevitable that some of that ugliness would trickle down from adults to kids. But, as the nomination of Morrow shows, it's even worse than that. For years now, through ""don't say gay"" laws and groups like Moms for Liberty, the MAGA movement has been actively trying to remake America's schools in their own image. Where MAGA goes, violence follows. Ignore the glib denials of Republican leaders about school violence. Judge them by what they do - and who they support going into the 2024 election.

If you're already in on the skincare secret that is CeraVe, congratulations - but if you have always wondered if this $15 moisturizing cream is worth the hype, we're here to tell you that the answer is an emphatic ""yes."" The skincare brand was so popular on TikTok, that there was a CeraVe shortage, in part because of TikTok's major skincare influencer @skincarebyhyram brought the products to light - that's what happens when millennials and Gen Z figure out the power of a drugstore brand. Although many moisturizers aren't made for multiple skin types, CeraVe's version is, ranging from normal to sensitive. It is particularly excellent for dry, sensitive skin, though. This moisturizing cream boasts a lot of ingredients your skin is going to love, like hyaluronic acid, ceramides and Multivesicular Emulsion technology (MVE). Hyaluronic acid provides hydration and that overall glow-y look, while ceramides boost your skin barrier, keeping it protected from outside irritants, and MVE releases the hydration throughout the day, so you don't feel dry again two hours after applying. Not only is it on sale for $15 on Amazon, but it's from a brand beloved by stars like Olivia Wilde, Busy Philipps, Blake Lively, AOC, and Gabrielle Union. It's no wonder it's currently Amazon's number one selling face moisturizer.  CeraVe Moisturizing Cream $15$2025% off Buy Now Don't forget that this moisturizer can also be used on your body. You might have a bad association with men using a 2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner, but reviewers promise that this moisturizing cream really is effective both on your face and body. Don't just take my word for it - CeraVe's moisturizer has over 100,000 five-star reviews on Amazon. You read that right, over 100,000 (!) five-star reviews! I've been covering products on Amazon for years, and I've never seen such a high Amazon rating on a skincare product before. Clearly, it's doing something right and the reviews do an excellent job at proving that.  ""My fountain of youth cream,"" wrote one shopper. ""I love this cream! I have been using it for a while and the 19oz last forever. You only have to use a little of it to moisturize your skin. I have very sensitive skin but this creamhas never caused any skin irritation. I use it in the morning and at night. I am 76-years-old but no one believes my age. Most of my friends are in their late fifties or sixties. Hyaluronic acid is what gives you the moisture needed. The Ceramideshelp restore the skin barrier and help prevent wrinkles. I have had people tell me, ""but you have no wrinkles"" and I say it is because of my CeraVe. I will continue to use it as long as it remains on the market because it is my facelift in a container.""  Another shopper added, ""Magical for under eye wrinkles(!) and everything else."" One reviewer claimed is was ""amazing"" for patchy, dry skin, especially during winter. They wrote, ""This southern gal has struggled badly with dry skin since I had to move to a much colder climate, especially during the colder months! I get dry flaky skin on my hands and legs especially; on my legs it is so bad that sometimes I cannot help scratching until it bleeds or leaves a rash. I even do it in my sleep. It is... not my favorite thing. This product specifically is a lifesaver for me. Since using it, I no longer have the above issues with my skin ...

"April 2, 2024","Andrew Scott and Dakota Fanning say their 'Ripley' characters aren't rivals, 'they're frenemies'",40,"  In early March, as the collective obsession it spawned was at its height, I had the chance to ask: Have Andrew Scott and Dakota Fanning seen the viral TikTok series ""Who TF Did I Marry?"" The actors were seated in a sparsely decorated holding room at a Hollywood screening venue where their new series, ""Ripley,"" was about to be previewed. Nearly seven decades after Patricia Highsmith's novel ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" first introduced the world to its titular grifter, Tom, the story of one of pop culture's most infamous pathological liars is now getting an eight-episode treatment on Netflix. And the 50-part social media saga by Reesa Teesa (real name Tareasa Johnson) about a walking red flag - an ex-husband who allegedly made up family members, faked phone conversations and, in their search for a home, duped her with fake bank statements that turned out to be screenshots from Google Images - was further proof that stories of scammers and fraudsters never go out of style. ""Oh, my God, I know!"" Fanning said, her eyes wide with excitement. ""I wanted to watch that, but haven't. There are a lot of videos, right?""  ""What is this?"" Scott asked, curious to understand the enthusiasm. ""It's this woman who got scammed by her ex and made these videos where she is like filming in the bathroom or her car and telling the story,"" Fanning said. ""Oh, wow,"" Scott said, brows furrowed. The cunning con man who's brought them together has left a more lasting impression, inspiring the 1960 French film ""Purple Noon,"" the 1999 vehicle for Matt Damon, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law, and now ""Ripley."" Developed for television by Steven Zaillian (""The Night Of""), the series was originally set up at Showtime before moving to Netflix, with production spanning from summer 2021 to spring 2022. The lavish thriller, which is shot in black and white, stars Scott as the eponymous scam artist; Johnny Flynn (""Emma"") as Dickie Greenleaf, the wayward heir to a wealthy Manhattan dynasty with whom Ripley becomes obsessed; and Fanning as Marge Sherwood, Dickie's girlfriend, who is suspicious of the new man in town. The dark, subversive antihero saga begins as Tom is enlisted by Dickie's father , who mistakenly assumes Tom is a friend of his son , to venture to Italy to cajole him into returning home. Tom becomes infatuated with Dickie and his lifestyle, then kills him to avoid being deserted - and the cover-up spirals from there. It's an apt parable for the social media age, in which the carefully crafted image can be seductive to a damaging degree. But Zaillian didn't embark on the adaptation with that in mind. ""It had nothing to do with now,"" Zaillian said by telephone. ""The big draw for me was to spend more time with this particular character. ... I think there's a lot of things about him that are like all of us. He has aspirations, he has envy, pride - he might have more than we have, or he's just willing to go further to get it. I think one of the reasons that he's endured as a character so well over all these years, is because we do relate to him."" While Dickie is the person Tom becomes fascinated by, the dynamic between Tom and Marge brings the tension. ""Their relationship changes,"" Zaillian said. ""From the moment she meets him, Marge is suspicious of him. At a certain point, he appeals to her vanity. She starts to think, 'Well, maybe he is OK,' because, frankly, she's gonna get something out of it. And so it kind of goes back and forth. Her opinion on him constantly changes."" Scott and Fanning talked about their own experiences being duped, why we can't get enough of con artists, and climbing all the series' stairs. What do you think it is about con artists that audiences stay fascinated by? Scott: We talk so much about backstory when we're talking about characters and I sometimes think that's just mythical, because when you've got backstory about somebody, you have power. When you don't, [the character has] all the power. It's more sinister.  Fanning: I think Tom Ripley is the original catfish. Also, what kind of separates it from other interpretations of con men, or whatever you want to call it, is you kind of get to see how he does it all, in pretty gripping detail. Sometimes some of those details are glossed over; in this, you're on that ride of how it's all done and I think that makes the particular character of Tom Ripley even scarier. Also, you start sympathizing with him. Scott: And you see his mistakes.  Fanning: I should want him to get caught, but I don't.  Scott: I was always like, ""I want to be able to feel what it's like to be him, not necessarily be a victim of his"" ... ""What would I do if I was him in these moments?"" ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" really asks the question, ""Is it better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody?"" And it grapples with the cost of buying into the life you're fed to believe is ideal. What did you find interesting in exploring the complexity of those themes against the social media era we live in? Scott: It's about somebody who's literally not being seen by a lot of people. Really just lives in the undergrowth. What I find moving about it is that I think he's got a great appreciation for all the stuff that Dickie Greenleaf just takes for granted. He's really brilliant at what he does. Dickie and, to a certain extent Marge, are not great artists, but they have that totally at their disposal. There's a theme of who gets access to the arts, and who is able to go to these beautiful locations and educate [themselves]. Tom, as he's doing all these extraordinary things, is actually falling in love with Italy, painting and food and clothes and just the beauty of the world.  As an actor, your goal is to make an audience believe that you're somebody else and you will go to your own lengths to do that. Did it give you insight into what's driving Tom or how far he'll take it? Scott: He's not a natural-born killer. He's not going over there with any of this in mind. He's trying to survive.  Fanning: Somebody approached him. Scott: Exactly. Somebody approached him. He didn't do anything. Then he caught some feelings. Then that happened. All these extraordinary places he goes to aren't because he's going, ""Oh, I always wanted to go to Venice."" He goes there because he has to.  Maybe not to the extent ofwhatwe see in this series, but have you ever been duped? Fanning: The feeling that I hate the most is being tricked and duped - even in small ways when you feel like everyone else knows something that you don't know. I hate that. It's awful. Scott: I will give you a specific example that happened to me last week. I arrived to Los Angeles. I was really jet-lagged, it was about 8 o'clock. I thought: OK, I'm going to go to the gym to keep me alive. And it's a well-known, good gym. Went to do my workout and put my stuff in the locker. When I finished and went to take a shower, I thought, I'm not gonna put my trainers into my locker; I'm only going to be in the shower for five minutes. I come out and someone had stolen my trainers! There's just one sock there. I was like, ""What the f-?"" You just feel so violated. And I'm thinking, ""I have to go home. My shoes are gone."" So I had to wear these extraordinarily massive flip-flops from the spa. I still can't believe someone stole my trainers and one sock. But it is a really weird feeling to be stolen from. I know you can be emotionally conned. I've experienced that before as well, with one of those bank fraud things. You do feel something has just been ripped from you. It's a horrible feeling.  Tom is always paranoid about being watched. You both are public figures. Can you understand that paranoia? Fanning: It doesn't just have to do with being an actor or a celebrity anymore. I try and keep everything together. But there was one time that I was learning to drive and I was with my mom. We didn't have a destination; I was just practicing. And there was paparazzi following behind me every turn and watching me park. I finally got out of the car and I was like, ""I am trying to learn to drive. I am not going anywhere. You're going to be going up and down this hill all day."" He was very nice. One time, I was moving into my house and my garage and he - it happened to be the same man - was parked nearby and I was like, ""Please don't film me moving my personal items into my house."" But in general, I think now everybody worries about being surveilled in some way. Andrew, do you notice when it's happening to you? When someone has their phone positioned a certain way? Scott: Absolutely. And my real feeling about it is: just be better at it. Be better at disguising it! Not for anything to do with what my job is, just as a human being. It's the fact that you think I can't notice how obvious you are making it. Recently, I was on the tube in London, it was this relatively empty tube, and this girl [mimics person pointing phone in his direction] and she very badly took a photo and the flash went off. And I turned and was like, ""If you want a picture, please just ask me."" And she was like, ""I didn't take a picture of you."" Somebody from down the car was like, ""Mate, we saw it. You did. The flash went off."" So then she got up and got off at the stop. The shame. She was Tom Ripley! She was just lying to my face.  I want to talk more about the Marge-and-Tom dynamic. Unlike the 1999 adaptation, where Marge is more warm and welcoming to Tom and wants him to fit in, in the series, like in the novel, she's skeptical of him from the start. How did you map out the pacing of her wariness? Fanning: The interesting thing about the novel and the scripts is that they're written from Tom's perspective. The other characters have to fill in a lot of blanks. At first, that felt overwhelming. But Steve's gift is his precision as a writer and as a director and the fact that he, whether it's what you want to hear or not, knows exactly what he's looking for and what he wants. I think my instinctual interpretation of Marge he was happy with, which was a relief to me. But we definitely played with it, like, ""Let's do a take where she doesn't believe him"" or ""Let's do one where she isn't so skeptical."" And then he would figure it out later - what Marge knew, what Marge didn't know. It was a little bit of a puzzle of keeping track of the timeline of her skepticism. But I was thrilled to play a character, a woman, that wasn't completely duped. I love that this Marge is quite skeptical from the beginning and we got to have fun with that.  They're very much a mirror of each other. Fanning:And her background is also not a privileged background. The jealousy of her is, ""You and I are alike, but you have it and I don't. And you don't deserve it still."" Scott: They see through each other. They're threatened by each other and you dislike about other people what you see in yourself. But I really believe that Tom loves Marge. I think it's too easy to think: ""Oh, he hates her."" I think he finds her inconvenient because she, of all people, might mess it up for him. And Dickie is a little bit more trusting or maybe just not as emotionally intelligent.  Fanning: They're frenemies.  Sexuality in Patricia's novels is sort of up to interpretation sometimes; it's subtext. Andrew, what discussions did you have with Steven about how you wanted to approach that part of his identity? Scott: I suppose it was something that I thought about a lot myself; it was very important to me to not label him too much. I did have some brief conversations with Steve about that. ... We're very concerned with labeling in 2024. I feel like he's a character with a lot of secrets. And talking around it too much, I feel I've got to protect that character. I think you have to dramatize asking the questions rather than drowning the character in giving the easy answer to appease certain people's ideas. To my mind, he's a character who is Other. I feel like he wouldn't be comfortable in a gay bar; I feel like he wouldn't be comfortable in a straight bar. Sometimes I think his sexuality or sensuality comes out of his relationship with things- art, clothes, props, music. I love the fact that we don't know. I think there's a lot of people who can relate to that. I enjoy the idea of pushing that - for him to be flirtatious with a man; for him to be flirtatious with a woman - and not diagnose him too much and not to impose too much of a sexuality. And I applied that to everything about him, not just his sexuality. He's the hero, but he's an unreliable hero.  In the book, the three characters are very clearly telegraphed as being in their early to mid-20s, fresh out of college. How does a version of these characters who are somewhat closer to your age change your understanding of their behavior? Fanning: I didn't think about it. I feel like everyone is almost ageless in it. Obviously with Marge, you can tell she's somebody who is kind of bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and finds herself in this place and hasn't had a lot of experience. She's not a world traveler. This could be her first time out of the country. If I was thinking about age, I was thinking this is all still kind of new for her.   Scott: It was a concern because, obviously, in the book, he's younger than I am... But that's not what [Highsmith] concerns herself with too much. Again, the sort of slipperiness of watching their behaviors and not caught up with: ""What's the age difference here?"" We're not playing something like the evolution of teenagers. That's not what the theme of it is and, so, it isn't really something that we thought about. Fanning: Steve didn't care, so we didn't care. Andrew, talk to me about the stairs. You had to endure a lot of stairs in the series. Fanning: Oh God. Scott: There was a lot of stairs. We got a lot of coverage ... of a lot of stairs.  I can't tell by the tone if he's really upset by the memory. Fanning: [laughs] No, he's not upset. It's just the truth. Scott: [laughs] It's just the truth. That's the thing - it's very evocative because when you go [to Italy], you're going up lots of stairs. There's no choice. To see what it's like for a person from New York, who's experiencing this for the first time and has no money, and he's making mistakes, he can't speak the language. But yes, there's a lot of those stair scenes where he's got up and life is just tough. Steve isn't a one-and-done guy, so we certainly had a lot of takes with the stairs.

"February 28, 2024",Andy Cohen rep speaks out amid 'RHONY' star Leah McSweeney's lawsuit: 'Completely false',41,"  Andy Cohen's team has spoken out after ""Real Housewives"" star Leah McSweeney sued the TV personality, Bravo and NBCUniversal for encouraging a ""dangerous work environment"" and ""substance abuse."" In a statement shared with The Times on Wednesday, a representative for Cohen said, ""the claims against Andy are completely false."" The response made no direct mention of McSweeney, who filed Tuesday in New York federal court, nor her allegations.  She is also taking legal action against unscripted TV outlet Shed Media US, and producers John Paparazzo, Lisa Shannon and Darren Ward, The Times has learned. McSweeney shared the news of her lawsuit on Tuesday evening, telling her Instagram followers in a statement that ""your favorite Bravo shows are run by people who create a dangerous work environment, encourage substance abuse to artificially create drama and cynically prey on the vulnerabilities of their employees."" In her statement - which made no mention of Cohen - McSweeney slammed the ""Real Housewives"" franchise's bosses for allegedly creating a ""workplace culture where toxicity, alcoholism and pain are not only expected but encouraged and facilitated."" The 41-year-old fashion designer, who has previously spoken about her struggles with addiction, said the alleged behind-the-scenes substance abuse ""is something I most definitely did not sign up for."" She added: ""There is nothing more important than my sobriety, without it I risk losing everything."" In the 109-page lawsuit, reviewed by The Times, McSweeney alleges that ""Housewives"" producers were aware of her battle with addiction and mental health disorders, but discriminated against her by ""intentionally planning scenarios intended to exacerbate [her] disabilities."" McSweeney's complaint also alleged Cohen ""engages in cocaine use"" with other ""Housewives"" stars, Bravo personalities and ""his employees."" The suit alleged that the TV host's alleged cocaine use promotes ""a workplace culture that thrives off drug and alcohol abuse,"" one that McSweeney claims does not accommodate employees who are disabled and trying to remain drug-free. The ""Housewives"" franchise has been embroiled in a web of allegations in recent months. Last week, Cohen reportedly faced allegations of sexual harassment from former ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" cast member Brandi Glanville. Page Six reported on Feb. 22 that Glanville's legal team sent a letter to Cohen, alleging that in 2022 he sent the ex-model a video of himself ""obviously inebriated"" speaking about wanting to engage in sexual acts with another Bravo personality.  In response to the allegations, Cohen posted on X: ""It was absolutely meant in jest, and Brandi's response clearly communicated she was in on the joke. That said, it was totally inappropriate and I apologize."" And before raising sexual assault claims of her own, Glanville was accused in Januaryof sexual harassment and assault by ""Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip"" co-star Caroline Manzo. McSweeney officially joined the ""RHONY"" main cast in 2020 for Season 12, but seemingly confirmed her departure from the series two years later. In 2022, she shareda TikTok video in which she refers to herself as ""a former 'Real Housewife of New York.'"" The ""Chaos Theory"" author said on Instagram that she hopes her lawsuit helps reality TV return to its roots: ""To authentically depict the complexities of life while offering genuine support to those who share their stories."" She added: ""Bravo can try to manipulate my reality and others' all they want, but the cold hard facts of this case are as real as it gets."" McSweeney is seeking an unspecified amount in damages including payment for legal fees, lost wages, and mental and emotional distress. She seeks a trial by jury.  A legal representative for McSweeney did not immediately respond to The Times' request for comment. Times researcher Cary Schneider contributed to this report.

"February 29, 2024",Are TikTok and Instagram dulling your taste?,42,"  Partway through Kyle Chayka's new book, ""Filterworld,"" about how digital algorithms transform culture, a quote from one of his subjects stopped me cold. Valerie Peter, a younger woman interviewed for the book, had never liked legwarmers. But in late 2021, legwarmers became a pervasive fashion trend on Instagram, TikTok and Pinterest. She felt compelled to buy a pair. The decision felt almost subconscious, disturbingly so. It were as if clout-chasing influencers and surveillance-based digital advertising had somehow corrupted her self-identity. ""I just want to know that what I like is what I actually like,"" Peter said.  Good luck, I thought. I pictured the ending from Alex Garland's 2018 sci-fi film ""Annihilation,"" where Natalie Portman's character, Lena, confronts a faceless extraterrestrial that mimics, with growing violence, her every move. It's the strange dance of today's surveillance economy: Users give platforms data, which platforms use to adapt to the user (and sell more precisely targeted ads), which in turn better adapts the user to the platform. Every algorithm-driven platform is an alien lifeforce that acts more like you over time, even if it's enabling your belief in a conspiracy theory or dangerously reinforcing a depressive episode.  ""Algorithmic recommendations are addictive because they are always subtly confirming your own cultural, political, and social biases, warping your surroundings into a mirror image of yourself while doing the same for everyone else,"" Chayka writes. ""This had made me anxious, the possibility that my view of my own life - lived through the Internet - was a fiction formed by the feeds."" So he went on an algorithm cleanse and quit social media, going cranky from the cognitive withdrawal at first. He read David Brooks out of sheer boredom. Took fewer photos. Gained clarity. In ""Filterworld,"" Chayka, a writer who covers technology and internet culture for the New Yorker, uses taste as the primary lens through which to explore this cycle of adaptation and alienation that now defines our encounters with many tech platforms. Chayka's view is that the proliferation of recommendation algorithms on services like Netflix, Spotify and TikTok since the 2010s have created a cultural world that's flatter, more homogenous and more passively consumed. The book is part of a long-building, now-maturing backlash against the uncanny mental world, our world, that the tech industry has built over the past two decades. ""In place of the human gatekeepers and curators of culture, the editors and DJs, we now have a set of algorithmic gatekeepers,"" Chayka writes. ""While this shift has lowered many cultural barriers to entry, since anyone can make their work public online, it has also resulted in a kind of tyranny of real-time data. Attention becomes the only metric by which culture is judged, and what gets attention is dictated by equations developed by Silicon Valley engineers."" If taste - aesthetic judgment - is a human skill cultivated by a lifetime of gazing, reading, listening and selecting, recommendation algorithms are like the new robots powering up to take over the assembly line of our intentionality. These mathematical helpers reduce selection time and boost the efficiency of seeing pictures, watching TV shows and hearing songs: more and faster. Meanwhile, the humans who used to browse the shelves in libraries or at Blockbusters become button-pushers a little less good at looking around. No need to stress over finding the right album for your mood anymore. Just listen to this Spotify playlist of lofi beats to relax to.  Whenever your environment gets automated, you become a little more of an automatic person. ""There are 'lean-in' moments, when the user is paying attention, choosing what to consume and actively judging the result,"" Chayka writes of active and passive modes of content consumption on platforms. ""And there are 'lean-back' moments, when users coast along with content running in the background, not worrying too much about what it is or what plays next. Algorithmic recommendations push us toward the latter category, in which we are fed culture like foie-gras ducks, with more regard for volume than quality - because volume, sheer time spent, is what makes money for the platform through targeted advertising."" Time to rebel! I for one, as a former English major, am vulnerable to humanities-based arguments of decline; our lives (or at least our moods) might improve modestly if we went around smashing a few more machines. Nonetheless, Chayka's version of taste is an unreliable instrument for establishing the extent that Big Tech is achromatizing the last bit of color out of our souls. A much older cultural anxiety is also afoot here. Chayka defines taste as an elevated subjectivity, a way you consciously place yourself both within and against the world: ""We make constant decisions to listen to, read, or wear one thing instead of another. These choices are intimate, reflecting our ephemeral moods and the slow building of our individual sensibilities - of our senses of self. ... Tasteis a word for how we measure culture and judge our relationship to it.""  Taste is how you discriminate, in the most neutral sense of that word. But later, the emphasis on taste, a capacity theoretically any human has, shifts toward good taste, a quality of the few rather than the many: ""When taste is too standardized, it is degraded. ... Consumption without taste is just undiluted, accelerated capitalism."" A whiff of social status drifts in: ""There are two forces forming our tastes ... the first is our independent pursuit of what we individually enjoy, while the second is our awareness of what it appears that most other people like, the dominant mainstream. The two may move in opposite directions, but it's often easier to follow the latter, particularly when the Internet makes what other people are consuming so immediately.""  So if everyone else is jumping off the bridge of Marvel's ""Madame Web"" (12% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, 57% audience score), you don't have to follow them. Go listen to some 12-tone Schoenberg string quartets and commune with God, and your selfhood will remain secure. But Chayka's valid analysis of how algorithmic curation dulls our creative agency overlaps messily with the centuries-old anxiety of the aesthete within modernity, where all subjective opinions are ultimately equal, never more-so than in the marketplace. ""These days the fee even for authors of repute is very small, whereas the tips dropped to the literary hacks are very considerable,"" Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard bemoaned in 1846. What the internet performs, and what platforms perfect, is an occult crowd summoning that illustrates just how outnumbered and irrelevant the snob really is. Picture the food critic from ""Ratatouille,"" Anton Ego, standing amid the biggest never-ending Black Friday mall crush in human history, and you've got an idea of how it feels to create a Substack newsletter in 2024 to write some literary essays for the web.  This particular flattening effect of platforms comes less from the rise of manipulative algorithmic whizbangery than the sheer presence of other peopleand the consumer purchasing power they represent. ""In the place of physical hotels and airports, we have Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok as spaces of congregation that erase differences,"" Chayka writes. ""There is now also the generic global consumer, whose preferences and desires are molded more by the platforms they use than where they live."" Access to a massive global market, combined with powerful analytics and social media feedback effects, create ever-more powerful incentives for even genius creatives to give the crowd the mush it wants. Rotten Tomatoes is one of those places where you can still watch the old culture fight the new in a grotesque pit. (Isn't my love for romantic schlock like 1997's ""The Saint,"" starring Val Kilmer in an absurd number of disguises, just as valid as the British Film Institute's adoration of ""Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles"" as the greatest film of all time?) The review-aggregation website has different percentages to measure the mood of the experts versus the mood of the masses, kind of like a weather forecast that tells you what kind of class warfare the new ""Spider-Man"" is unleashing this week.  ""The behavior of these social media hordes represents an anti-democratic, anti-intellectual mind-set that is harmful to the cause of art and antithetical to the spirit of movies,"" longtime New York Times film critic A.O. Scott bemoaned in a farewell essay explaining why he was leaving film criticism. ""Fan culture is rooted in conformity, obedience, group identity and mob behavior, and its rise mirrors and models the spread of intolerant, authoritarian, aggressive tendencies in our politics and our communal life."" So let's say all this consumer unthinkingness and the enclosure of new intellectual possibilities is incipient fascism. Unplug to end the alien dance and go find yourself: the authentic you, away from the data surveillance, away from the crowds. It will almost certainly be more restful, as Chakya found. But trying to find some neighborhood of your city that hasn't been impacted in some way by an internet platform is like searching for a corner of Earth untouched by climate change. Google and Waze have changed cities' traffic patterns; Yelp directs eaters to some restaurants over others, influencing which ones close and which survive; Spotify playlists are running in the the restaurant you picked; TikTok fashion trends are reflected in the clothes of the people you see; people have transformed their own faces in pursuit of homogenous Instagram beauty standards.  The digital is the real. Recommendation algorithms, the companies that control them and the crowds that use them have already recreated the world. What matters most isn't an unattainable sense of individual authenticity - you're not some Philip K. Dick cyborg who can sync up and cycle back to factory settings, purging the hard drive to compress yourself just small enough to slip through the firewall of human history.

"January 26, 2024",Art House Movies Are Having Their TikTok Moment,43,"  The wrestling drama The Iron Claw has quietly grossed $31.5?million domestically at the box office since its Christmas launch, a veritable fortune for an independent film in the post-pandemic age and one of the best showings ever for distributor A24. And it isn't the only specialty movie doing impressive business these days thanks to a powerful new ally: younger adults.  For years, art house movies relied on the ""elderverse,"" as one indie executive puts it - i.e., moviegoers over age 35 or 40. But that relationship collapsed during the COVID-19 crisis and has yet to be fully restored. At the same time, the 18-to-34 crowd started snubbing once-surefire genres like superhero fare and began venturing beyond their comfort zone. ""Also, people are realizing that streaming is leveling off. There's less good content to watch at home,"" adds Neon distribution chief Elissa Federoff. ""This is the strongest I can remember seeing this kind of turnout since the early 2000s,"" says Lisa Bunnell, president of distribution at Focus Features. More than 40 percent of ticket buyers to the opening weekend of The?Holdovers, directed by Alexander Payne and starring Paul Giamatti, were under 35, she says. The film has grossed an impressive $18.8 million to date since its October launch, and is being rereleased in theaters over the Jan. 27-29 weekend after picking up five Oscar nominations, including best picture and best actor (as an example of its success, it has earned more than last year's best picture contender The Fabelmans, which topped out at $17.3 million domestically). On the opening weekend of Iron Claw - starring Zac Efron and The Bear's Jeremy Allen White as the Von Erich brothers of wrestling fame - more than 60 percent of tickets buyers were 35 and under, including a large chunk between ages 18 and 24. The heart-wrenching movie went viral thanks to its cast, which also includes Harris Dickinson, and became a TikTok sensation when people seeing the film rushed to post videos of themselves crying. A24 is known for homing in on movies that appeal to younger generations. Lady Bird (2017) is another example (and one of its first films was Spring Breakers). Ditto for rival distributor Neon, home of the Oscar winner Parasite. The more traditional specialty distributors, including heavyweights Focus and Searchlight, are also benefiting from the boon as more and more younger adults discover specialized cinema. On its Dec. 8 opening weekend, Yorgos Lanthimos' Victorian era-set Poor Things, from Searchlight, saw 70 percent of ticket buyers under 35, followed by 66 percent on the second and 58 percent on the third. It has earned an impressive $21.4 million to date, and boasts 11 Oscar nominations, the most of any film behind Oppenheimer. (Box office observers say it's not exactly a surprise that Poor Things - a genre-defying film about sexual exploration and female freedom starring Emma Stone - would skew younger.) Yet even The Zone of Interest, a Holocaust drama (and another A24 title), is drawing a younger audience. ""For a movie of this subject to have more than half of the audience be under 35 is extremely noteworthy and encouraging. I think last year's specialty films - The Fablemans, The Banshees of Inisherin, Tár and Armageddon Time - all played older thematically and were more traditional, whereas some of this year's movies could play younger while still playing to an older review-driven audience,"" notes one specialty insider. Zone of Interest is likewise competing in the best picture Oscar race and claims a total of five noms. Fellow best picture contender American Fiction, from Amazon, is another film that is playing to both younger and older audiences, similar to Zone of Interest. On its opening weekend, more than 40 percent of ticket buyers were under the age of 34. The uptick at the specialty box office is noticeable when looking at the subdued domestic grosses of many of the specialty films competing in the last year's Oscar best picture race: The Banshees of Inisherin ($10.6 million), Tár ($6.8 million), Women Talking ($5.4 million) and Triangle of Sadness ($4.6 million). The big exception of course was A24's Everything Everywhere All at Once ($77.2 million). In terms of using the Oscar race to goose box office grosses, American Fiction had been holding back in terms of expanding until after nominations were announced and will jump from 850 theaters to more than 1,500 locations Jan. 27 (it has earned a promising $8.4 million to date). Poor Things will boost its location count from 1,400 to 2,200 cinemas. A24 is still going relatively slow with The Zone of Interest and will up the film's location count from 82 to just north of 300.  Amazon MGM Studios theatrical distribution chief Kevin Wilson recently handled two specialty movies that have appealed primarily to younger adults, Bottoms and Saltburn, which each grossed roughly $11 million last year in North America, a solid showing for these times. ""What's interesting is we're starting to see a young cinephile audience that is searching for more unique content,"" says Wilson. The exec also credits an up-and-coming new generation of stars, such as Saltburn's Barry Keoghan. Ask Wilson, Federoff, Bunnell or any other distribution chief in the specialty realm, and they'll tell you that Alamo Drafthouse has helped fuel this trend by providing an enticing and fun environment. (As it happens, Alamo co-founder Tim League was involved in the launch of Tom Quinn's Neon.) Also, loyalty programs offered by the big circuits are making it less cost prohibitive to go to the movies more frequently, says Federoff.  ""Now people can drink and hang out, and be in a social community,"" says Federoff. ""And it's partly a nostalgia thing, like coming back to records. People are reclaiming cinema.""

"March 26, 2024","BBC Boss Outlines Goals: ""Pursue Truth, Back British Storytelling, Bring People Together""",45,"  The BBC needs more partnerships with media, entertainment and technology giants, such as one with the Walt Disney Co. for sci-fi hit show Doctor Who, and change how it does business further in a competitive and polarized world. That was the message of Tim Davie, the director general of the U.K. public broadcaster, in a major Tuesday speech outlining his team's future focus amid technological and other changes as pursuing truth, backing British storytelling and uniting people.  The proactive, but considered, use of AI and ""ethical algorithms"" is also part of his plans for the broadcaster. Ahead of the BBC's annual report detailing spending plans for the next year, Davie addressed the ""future direction of the BBC and its role for the U.K."" during a Royal Television Society event, outlining how to use ""limited resources"" to best serve audiences, ""rapidly modernize"" and ""transform the value we provide for everyone,"" while ""growing the creative industries."" Saying that ""jeopardy is high,"" Davie argued that there are dangers for the U.K. ""democratically, socially and culturally"" and beyond, citing the likes of ""noisy culture wars, disinformation, the persecution of the free press."" Helping here can ""strong institutions, shared stories and social capital,"" he said. Pointing out ""almost universal admiration"" of the BBC around the world, Davie spoke out against ""complacency, defensiveness and arrogance."" And he noted financial challenges, the need to rethink traditional business models and change amid changing audience behavior. But he said that the British public spends more time with the BBC and its streaming service iPlayer than all streamers combined. Davie said the BBC has three essential roles to play and goals to pursue for democracy, society and the creative industries. They are: ""pursue truth with no agenda, back British storytelling, and bring people together."" On the first, he said that one key goal must be ""holding our center of gravity, staying true to our values."" The BBC will launch two new digital services as part of that. One will be a destination for ""deeper analysis, longer reads, and thought-provoking journalism."" The second is the launch of a BBC Investigations brand.  Davie also said the BBC would ""proactively deploy"" AI ""on our terms,"" supporting rightsholders, while ""never compromising human creative control,"" and sustaining the BBC's editorial standards. ""We are now working with a number of major tech companies on BBC-specific pilots which we will be deploying the most promising ones in coming months,"" he said.  Davie also promised the development and use of ""unique ethical algorithms"" that include increased personalization, but are ""not simply driven by the narrowing of an individual's recommendation,"" but also include serendipity, curiosity, and ""an interest in what our BBC editors may judge to be important stories."" ""With the backing of BBC Studios, we will invest in stronger direct-to-consumer services globally,"" Davie vowed. Relaunching BBC.com and the BBC app worldwide with appropriate commercialization to ""build up as the number 1 British news brand online"" is part of that goal, the director general detailed. ""Over time we will look at adding the best of our documentaries and podcasts to that service."" On backing British storytelling, Davie promised ""authentic British stories, beautifully produced,"" rather than a focus on an ""abstract"" notion of global appeal. He also said that the broadcaster will continue to push more creative work beyond London, targeting that more than 60 percent of the BBC's TV production will be outside London by 2026. ""Our creative industries are a growing £125 billion ($158 billion) success story based on a unique, globally admired system of public and commercial investment that has profited society,"" Davey said. ""But in a competitive global market, the pressure on huge international businesses to deliver efficiency creates genuine jeopardy for local IP and the telling of our stories. ...The BBC currently invests more in original British content than anyone. No one does more to champion new talent from every part of the U.K."" He continued: ""The BBC is a growth and innovation fund for the U.K., and we want to do even more to back British storytelling. This is not an insular strategy. We are a global brand. But as someone who ran BBC Studios, I can tell you that our most successful approach is to focus on our point of difference: authentic British stories produced beautifully, not worrying too much about an abstract notion of global appeal."" On priority three, bringing people together, the BBC wants to ensure shared moments and common cultural experiences and position itself against narrow algorithms sowing division. That includes the goal to ""not rely solely on U.S. and Chinese tech companies,"" he said. In that, the BBC boss doubled down on his warnings about social media giants, such as TikTok and Facebook, and called ""U.S. and Chinese algorithms the potential tastemakers of the future,"" as had emerged on Monday ahead of his speech. Despite ""budget pressures,"" the BBC will therefore ""prioritize big national occasions,"" Davie said. ""Dramatic changes"" in how the BBC operates will be needed for all this, he emphasized. A more audience-controlled broadcaster will be the result. If interested in a topic, audiences will get to mine BBC content across text, audio, photos video, and more. ""Noone is left behind in the digital transition,"" Davie highlighted a final goal. ""A free broadband-based TV service will be part of that, he said. ""These steps will help secure the future of the BBC, but more importantly, the vital role that a BBC can play for the U.K. at home and abroad in the years ahead,"" Davie concluded. What about funding this? Part of financial solutions will come down to refocusing existing capital to new priorities. For example, accelerating content spending ""towards streaming value and away from broadcast-only output"" is part of this strategy, the BBC boss said.  Working more closely with entertainment and tech giants will also be key, he said, promising: ""We will utilize commercial partners much more actively in areas like programming and technology to increase our horsepower."" Highlighting the ""deep pockets"" of tech titans, Davie argued: ""We do need major global partnerships with some of the tech players. We're an incredible testing ground. We are innovative, we can pilot things that maybe others can't develop. We've always had that history, but I don't think we can do it alone as a walled garden of R&D development. We're going to have to work with big companies. We have done this for a while in natural history and BBC Studios."" He explained that the BBC has developed new services and offers ""through partnership, majority funding coming from outside the U.K. boundaries,"" concluding: ""I think we need to push that into other areas to attract capital and create joint businesses in the U.K."" Concluded the BBC chief: ""We will need to work more strategically with the best tech companies to co-create solutions and form business partnerships that save money, inject capital and create better products."" Davie touted the partnership with Disney as well. ""Our recent deal with Disney on Doctor Who is a good example of how we can work to deliver more value through third-party funding, while protecting content for U.K. audiences,"" he explained. ""We will also continue to aggressively grow BBC Studios internationally, building our production capabilities and direct-to-consumer services like bbc.com andnow the wholly owned BritBox."" Davie on Tuesday also said the BBC and government will have to rethink the BBC World Service and investments in it given how much Russia, China and others put into funding of their respective services. ""One area that we will discuss with government is the World Service,"" Davie said in his speech. ""It is uniquely valuable and globally important. ... However, we cannot keep asking U.K. license fee payers to invest in it when we face cuts to U.K. services. We will need to discuss a long-term funding solution for the World Service that comes from central government budgets. Even in the short-term we will need more help. Russia and China are investing hard, and not properly funding one of the U.K.'s most valuable soft power assets makes no sense economically or culturally."" Also, a reform of the BBC license fee, through which U.K. taxpayers help fund the public broadcaster, including a close look at its scope and making it more progressive and fair, is needed, the BBC boss argued. Late in his appearance, Davie also said that the BBC was small and had growth potential in the ""shark-infested waters"" of the global media market.

Davie will also call ""U.S. and Chinese algorithms the potential taste-makers of the future,"" adding: ""Shared moments and unifying cultural experiences are increasingly rare."" The newspaper report did not quote the BBC boss as mentioning specific companies, but his comments were widely seen as calling out the likes of TikTok, Facebook and X. In line with that, the Telegraph report said that TikTok, which the U.S. Senate is set to consider banning unless its Chinese owner ByteDance sells it, said via a spokeswoman that it does not operate in China and that the BBC maintains multiple TikTok accounts. The company has also denied that it could be used as an espionage tool for the Chinese government. Facebook declined to comment, according to the Telegraph. A spokesman though referenced a statement from last year highlighted that less than three percent of users' feeds are made up of news content. Last week, Davie called the BBC ""fiercely independent"" and typically ""impartial"" despite such challenges as the ""storm of social media.""

"March 29, 2024",Bethenny Frankel Speaks Out About Being Hit in the Face Amid Alarming Trend,49,"  After numerous women have said that they were punched in the face in recent, seemingly random attacks in New York, Bethenny Frankel has shared she's among the victims of this alarming trend. The Real Housewives of New York alum first shared her experience in a comment left on a TikTok made by a Parsons fashion design student, who was hit while walking home from class. Frankel wrote, ""This is insane bc this happened to me a few months ago but I was embarrassed to say. I was on the UWS [Upper West Side]. Insane. I was taking video of a bakery."" After her comment drew attention, Frankel made a TikTok of her own Thursday, detailing her experience. ""I was in New York City looking for an apartment and I stopped at this cute little deli-bakery tiny place,"" she explained. ""I walked in and I was shooting the baked goods and as I turned around - I mean, the place was the size of a bathroom - I turned around to walk out the door, and this guy punched me. Hit me is more [accurate], it wasn't like a closed-fist, just hit me in the face."" She continued, ""I was completely stunned. I walked outside and my driver, who is also security, I looked at him and gestured over to this man, this homeless man, to explain to him that I'd just been hit. But I didn't want to provoke this guy even more. [My driver] went over and started confronting the guy and I was like, 'Let's get the hell out of here.'"" Frankel then texted the broker for the property and told him she didn't want to see any apartments in New York City anymore because ""this city's insane."" She noted, ""I attributed this to the crime that was happening during the pandemic. Little did I know that this would become this trend of people being hit and even when I commented in that post, I didn't know that it had been multiple people."" Frankel also shared support for the other women who've been victims in similar attacks and warned her 13-year-old daughter Bryn about it for her safety. @bethennyfrankel original sound - Bethenny Frankel On Wednesday, the NYPD released a statement on social media acknowledging the growing trend of women being hit in the face. They confirmed that one of the men who carried out the attacks was arrested and charged. The NYPD added that officers ""will continue to remain resilient in their efforts to stop violent criminals, ensuring the safety of our communities.""  The NYPD identified the arrested individual to Time magazine as 40-year-old Skiboky Stora, who previously ran for the District 9 seat on the New York City Council and had intended to run for mayor in 2025.  PIX11also reported that 33-year-old Franz Jeudy was arrested after a separate attack Thursday.

"April 4, 2024",Biden and Trump's main challenge? The apathetic voters who could decide the election,50,"  Although Haley Fox, 30, frequently chats politics with friends and family, she said, the moment the phrase ""election 2024"" comes up she feels her body fill with dread. ""There hasn't been anything that has represented me for a really long time,"" said Fox, a San Diego-based photographer. ""So, like, 2024, just seeing what we have to choose from - it just feels so bleak."" For Fox and many other Americans, election-year ennui is setting in. President Biden and former President Trump became their parties' presumptive nominees weeks ago, capping one of the shortest primary seasons in U.S. history and beginning the long runway to the general election. ""It's essentially two incumbents running against each other, is how it feels,"" said Jared Sichel, a GOP strategist and co-founder of the Costa Mesa-based Republican marketing firm Winning Tuesday. ""It's kind of just Groundhog Day for a lot of people."" Voters who don't want either option - ""double haters,"" as they're dubbed - make up about 15% of the electorate, according to polling last month from USA Today and Suffolk University. Other polls show their share to be closer to one-fifth of the electorate. In a neck-and-neck race between Trump and Biden, the bloc will be crucial in November. But whether they will turn out to vote is the million-dollar question. Most Californians are not looking forward to voting for president this year, according to a February report from the Public Policy Institute of California. Although 84% of Californians agreed that the 2024 election is ""very important,"" fewer than 4 in 10 said they are ""extremely"" or ""very"" enthusiastic about voting for president. Democrats are less enthused than Republicans, and independents are more apathetic than either party, the study found.  The palpable apathy among voters has played out in low turnout in primaries across the country. Elections in presidential years typically get a boost from all of the national media attention. But the Washington Post found that just 10% of voters nationwide had cast their ballots in primaries through mid-March. California saw just 34% of registered voters cast ballots on Super Tuesday, according to the secretary of state - the second-lowest presidential year primary turnout in the state's history. (Just 31% of the state's registered voters cast primary ballots in 2012, then-President Obama's reelection year.) Despite having more options for voting than ever, Los Angeles County was among the five California counties with the lowest voter turnouts in the March 5 primary, with 29% of registered voters casting ballots, the secretary of state reported. The low turnout came despite California moving its primary day to Super Tuesday, to align with 14 other states and American Samoa and encourage more voters to participate. The Biden campaign, which was mostly quiet through Super Tuesday, launched its big push after the president's State of the Union address two days later. His fiery speech, which pundits widely labeled as his way to fight against the narrative that he's too old at 81 for another four years as president, kicked off a multiweek tour through key swing states. Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, First Lady Jill Biden and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff made stops in Nevada, Arizona and even California. Biden and his surrogates headlined multiple fundraisers, racking up more cash to add to the campaign's burgeoning coffer of $155 million, according to the latest finance reports. His financing far outpaces the $42 million that Trump's campaign had at the end of February. ""The stakes of this election couldn't be higher, and our campaign is investing our historic resources in reaching voters where they are, earning every vote, and making sure the American people know how much is on the line this November,"" senior Biden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement.  ""As Donald Trump promises to be a dictator on day one, rip away women's freedom to choose, and rig the economy for himself and his wealthy friends at the expense of the middle class,"" she continued, ""it's clear his toxic agenda and lack of resources mean he's got nothing to win over the voters who will decide this election."" Trump, meanwhile, has been busy with court appearances for his multimillion-dollar civil fraud judgment and preparations for the first of his four criminal trials, scheduled for April 15. He has also continued to be active on Truth Social, his social media platform, blasting Biden and independent candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment. ""The more that Trump is able to stay out of the news, or at least [if] what he's saying is focused on Biden, he will be able to probably turn out some of the more independent voters,"" Sichel said. ""I think the Biden campaign's turnout is much more going to be based on alarm about Trump than excitement about Biden."" But while the dueling campaigns fight for relevance among apathetic voters, their messages are not always cutting through the noise. ""It's the boy who cried wolf,"" Fox said. ""OK, here we go again - democracy is at stake."" ""That was the theme of the campaign in 2020 ... battling for the soul of the nation,"" said Mark Gonzalez, chair of the Los Angeles County Democratic Party. ""Every time we say this, it's the most important election of our lifetime. But this one, in particular, is showcasing in [Trump's] presidency all of the damage he had done."" The county parties share a rare moment of unity in their messaging to encourage turnout and combat apathy: Vote local. ""Our message as a county party is to say there is no election more important than that for city council, board of supervisors, state Assembly and state Senate,"" said Roxanne Hoge, a volunteer for the Republican Party of Los Angeles County. Hoge's challenge is making disgruntled Republicans living in majority-Democratic Los Angeles County understand that the best way to channel their frustration is through voting. ""You miss 100% of the shots you don't take. So don't complain. You know things aren't great,"" Hoge said. ""You got a ballot; you'll get one in October - turn it in."" Breanne Deam, 34, didn't vote in 2020 or 2016. And though the Yucaipa resident said she complains about politics with friends and family members regularly, she said she's likely not to vote again this year. ""I know voting makes a difference. I think it does,"" said Deam, an independent. ""But those are just not my candidates."" Biden hasn't delivered on his campaign promises, Deam said, and she worries about his age. Trump brings too much baggage to please enough voters, she added, making this election feel particularly tense. She finds supporters of both candidates angry, and thinks America needs a candidate who can unite voters. ""It feels like a divorce. It seems like one is the mom and one's the dad and we're the kid,"" Deam said. ""At the end of the day, they don't care about anyone but themselves."" Fox, the San Diego photographer, voted unenthusiastically for Biden in 2020, deeming him a better choice than Trump. But she has watched in dismay his handling of the Israel-Palestinian crisis. ""For somebody whose grandparents emigrated here from Palestine, I cannot vote for Biden,"" she said.  But Trump is also a no-go for the registered Democrat - and she couldn't remember the name of the third-party candidate who had once piqued her interest. (She later recalled that it was Claudia De la Cruz of the Party for Socialism and Liberation.) Fox was once an enthusiastic follower of politics, tuning in to presidential election debates and keeping up with current events. Even though she wants to stay informed, Fox said, she has taken a step back from keeping up with the daily rigmarole of politics. ""Now it's become something that feels like this really depressing chore,"" Fox said. ""Like, 'Well, I guess I'm gonna figure out what's going on for the election that I don't want to vote in.'"" The most she can do now, she said, is consume a few videos or op-eds about the Middle East conflict before tuning out and playing some easygoing TikTok videos to lighten the mood.  But the road from primaries to November's general election is long, and much can change over the next seven months.  ""I don't know how much the candidates or the campaigns are going to be able to drive turnout as much as events that are outside of their control,"" said Sichel, the Republican strategist. ""Because, you know, who doesn't already know where they stand on Trump and Biden?"" When Lynne, a 70-year-old voter in Long Beach who declined to give her last name, cast her ballot on Super Tuesday, she encouraged her fellow voters to stay focused. ""We can't think about the president so much; we'll go crazy,"" Lynne said. ""Just focus on your own little part of the world. Make your own little part of the world better.""

"April 3, 2024","Biden, Xi have a 'candid' phone call; They discuss Taiwan, AI, fentanyl -- part of a push by the leaders to hold regular talks.",51,"  President Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping discussed Taiwan, artificial intelligence and security issues Tuesday in a call meant to demonstrate a return to regular leader-to-leader dialogue between the two powers. The call, described by the White House as ""candid and constructive,"" was the leaders' first conversation since their November summit in California produced renewed ties between the two nations' militaries and a promise of enhanced cooperation on stemming the flow of deadly fentanyl and its precursors from China. The call also kicks off several weeks of high-level engagements between the two countries, with Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen set to travel to China on Thursday and Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken to follow in the weeks ahead. Biden has pressed for sustained interactions at all levels of government, believing it is key to keeping competition between the two massive economies and nuclear-armed powers from escalating to direct conflict. While in-person summits take place perhaps once a year, officials said, both Washington and Beijing recognize the value of more frequent engagements between the leaders. Xi told Biden that the two countries should adhere to the bottom line of ""no clash, no confrontation"" as one of the principles for this year. ""We should prioritize stability, not provoke troubles, not cross lines but maintain the overall stability of China-U.S. relations,"" Xi said, according to China Central Television, the state broadcaster. The two leaders discussed Taiwan ahead of next month's inauguration of Lai Ching-te, the island's president-elect, who has vowed to safeguard its de facto independence from China and further align it with other democracies. Biden reaffirmed the United States' long-standing ""one China"" policy and reiterated that the U.S. opposes any coercive means to bring Taiwan under Beijing's control. China considers Taiwan a domestic matter and has vigorously protested U.S. support for the island. Taiwan remains the ""first red line not to be crossed,"" Xi told Biden, and emphasized that Beijing will not tolerate separatist activities by Taiwan's independence forces as well as ""exterior indulgence and support,"" which alluded to Washington's support for the island. Biden also raised concerns about China's operations in the South China Sea, including efforts last month to impede the Philippines, which the U.S. is obligated by treaty to defend, from resupplying its forces on the disputed Second Thomas Shoal. Next week, Biden will host Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at the White House for a summit in which China's influence in the region was set to be top of the agenda. Biden, in the call with Xi, pressed China to do more to meet its commitments to halt the flow of illegal narcotics and to restrict additional precursor chemicals to prevent their export. The pledge was made at their summit in Woodside, Calif., last year on the margins of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting. At the November summit, Biden and Xi also agreed that their governments would hold formal talks on the promises and risks of advanced artificial intelligence, which are set to take place in the coming weeks. The pair touched on the issue Tuesday, just two weeks after China and the U.S. joined more than 120 other nations in backing a resolution at the United Nations calling for global safeguards around the emerging technology. Biden, in the call, reinforced warnings to Xi against interfering in the 2024 U.S. elections as well as against continued malicious cyberattacks targeting critical American infrastructure, according to a senior U.S. administration official who previewed the call on condition of anonymity. He also raised concerns about human rights in China, including Hong Kong's new restrictive national security law and Beijing's treatment of minority groups, and he raised the plight of Americans detained in or barred from leaving China. The president also pressed his Chinese counterpart over Beijing's defense relationship with Russia, which is seeking to rebuild its industrial base as it continues with its war in Ukraine. And he called on Beijing to wield its influence over North Korea to rein in the isolated and erratic nuclear power. Biden also raised concerns with Xi over China's ""unfair economic practices,"" the official said, and reasserted that the U.S. would take steps to preserve its security and economic interests, including by continuing to limit the transfer of some advanced technology to China. Xi complained that the U.S. has taken more measures to suppress China's economy, trade and technology in the last several months and that the list of sanctioned Chinese companies has become ever longer, which is ""not derisking but creating risks,"" according to the broadcaster. The call came ahead of Yellen's visit to Guangzhou and Beijing for a week of bilateral meetings on the subject with finance leaders from the world's second-largest economy -- including Vice Premier He Lifeng, Chinese Central Bank Gov. Pan Gongsheng and former Vice Premier Liu He -- as well as American businesses and local leaders. An advisory for the trip states that Yellen ""will advocate for American workers and businesses to ensure they are treated fairly, including by pressing Chinese counterparts on unfair trade practices."" It follows Xi's meeting in Beijing with U.S. business leaders last week, when he emphasized the mutually beneficial economic ties between the two countries and urged people-to-people exchange to maintain the relationship. Xi told the Americans that the two countries have stayed communicative and ""made progress"" on issues such as trade, anti-narcotics and climate change since he met with Biden in November. Last week's high-profile meeting was seen as Beijing's effort to stabilize bilateral relations. Yellen last week said Beijing is flooding the market with green energy that ""distorts global prices."" She said she intends to share her beliefs with her counterparts that Beijing's increased production of solar energy, electric vehicles and lithium-ion batteries poses risks to productivity and growth to the global economy. U.S. lawmakers' renewed angst over Chinese ownership of TikTok has generated new legislation that would ban the popular social media app if its China-based owner, ByteDance, doesn't sell its stakes in the platform within six months of the bill's enactment. As chair of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which reviews foreign ownership of firms in the nation, Yellen has ample leeway to determine how the company could remain operating in the country. Meanwhile, China's leaders have set a goal of 5% economic growth this year despite a slowdown exacerbated by troubles in the property sector and the lingering effects of strict anti-virus measures during the COVID-19 pandemic that disrupted travel, logistics, manufacturing and other industries. China is the dominant player in batteries for electric vehicles and has a rapidly expanding auto industry that could challenge the world's established carmakers as it goes global. The U.S. last year outlined plans to limit EV buyers from claiming tax credits if they purchase cars containing battery materials from China and other countries that are considered hostile to the United States. Separately, the Department of Commerce launched an investigation into the potential national security risks posed by Chinese car exports to the U.S. Classification   Language: ENGLISH Document-Type: Wire Publication-Type: Newspaper Subject: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (90%); GOVERNMENT BODIES & OFFICES (90%); FENTANYL (89%); NARCOTICS (89%); OPIATES & OPIOIDS (89%); SEPARATISM & SECESSION (89%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (79%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (79%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (79%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (78%); NATIONAL SECURITY (78%); NATIONAL SECURITY & FOREIGN RELATIONS (78%); PRIME MINISTERS (78%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (78%); RED LINE ON WEAPONS (77%); DEMOCRACIES (74%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (70%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (70%); ILLEGAL DRUGS (50%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (50%); BIDEN, JOSEPH R JR (%); XI JINPING (%); UNITED STATES (%); CHINA (%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (%) Company: SEA LTD (51%) Ticker: SE (NYSE) (51%) Industry: NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES (51%); ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (90%); FENTANYL (89%); NARCOTICS (89%); OPIATES & OPIOIDS (89%); PUBLIC FINANCE AGENCIES & TREASURIES (70%); TREASURY DEPARTMENTS (70%) Person: JOE BIDEN (92%); XI JINPING (92%); ANTONY BLINKEN (79%); FERDINAND MARCOS JR (79%); FUMIO KISHIDA (79%); LAI CHING-TE (79%); JANET YELLEN (74%) Geographic: BEIJING, CHINA (93%); NORTH CENTRAL CHINA (91%); CALIFORNIA, USA (79%); PACIFIC OCEAN (79%); SOUTH CHINA SEA (79%); CHINA (98%); TAIWAN (95%); UNITED STATES (95%); PHILIPPINES (92%); JAPAN (79%) Load-Date: April 3, 2024"
"March 16, 2024",Bill Maher Says Artificial Intelligence Should Be a Bigger Concern Than TikTok,52,"  Amid the U.S. House passing a bill this week that would ban TikTok, Bill Maher wasted no time Friday sharing his thoughts on the controversial matter. To kick off the latest episode of HBO's Real Time, the host joked during his monologue, ""China, you know what, you can manufacture everything else that we use, but keeping our kids stupid, that's our job."" The bill, which passed by a vote of 352-65 in the House, would lead to a nationwide ban of the popular video app if its China-based owner, ByteDance, doesn't sell it. Lawmakers have expressed concerns that the company's current ownership structure is a national security threat. President Joe Biden has said if Congress passes the measure, he will sign it, however, the bill has to pass the Senate first. Later on Real Time, during his discussion with Republican Rep. Nancy Mace and Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna, Maher brought up the topic again, saying he feels like there are larger issues in the country at the moment than TikTok. He also pointed out how members of Congress ""pretty overwhelmingly"" voted to pass the bill, yet some politicians like Mace, Khanna, Donald Trump, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene - who are all on different sides of the political aisle - have expressed opposition to it. ""Explain to me why the people who are lining up against the bill and against getting it signed, you know, are saying, 'No, we can keep TikTok Chinese.' What is the common ground there?"" Maher asked. ""The common ground is the First Amendment in free speech,"" Khanna responded. ""I mean, it shows how out of touch Congress is that of all the issues in the country, the thing we can get done in three days is ban TikTok. That is the issue?"" He added that Congress should instead be looking at passing a ""data privacy law."" Mace also chimed in, noting, ""It's a First Amendment issue. I think it's potentially a Fifth Amendment issue. It's not the government's role to ban apps from the app store and websites."" While Maher agreed that he's also a ""free speech person,"" he later expressed there's a bigger issue that should be the focus in Congress, and that's artificial intelligence. ""I'm so much more concerned about AI,"" the host said. ""I mean, I heard you [Khanna] say this week that you think the first trillionaire in this country is going to be an AI entrepreneur. That to me is scarier than any of this, the idea of a trillionaire and also coming from AI. And by the way, the U.S. State Department said this week, worst case scenario, it [AI] poses an extinction-level threat to the human species."" Maher continued, ""You know, we see all these glitches in it and it doesn't pause us at all. It's like an arms race and we're the guinea pigs. And shouldn't the tech bros have been made to work out the bugs before they unleashed it on humanity? A little bit?"" Protections around the use of Artificial intelligence also emerged as a major sticking point in the writers and actors strikes last year. It has also been a hot-button issue among other industries, as well as Hollywood, about the threat it poses to jobs. Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder was also a guest on Real Time Friday during the one-on-one interview.

"November 18, 2023",Bill Maher Shares His Concerns on 'Real Time' About the Way Information Is Spread on TikTok,53,"  Bill Maher is sharing his thoughts on the way information is spread among young people on social media, particularly TikTok. On the latest episode of Real Time, the host addressed a now-deleted recent viral video on the social platform of a teen reading 9/11 terrorist leader Osama bin Laden's 2002 ""Letter to America,"" which includes antisemitic statements and seeks to justify the 9/11 attacks in the U.S. that left nearly 3,000 people dead and thousands of others injured. ""The kids now have jumped on TikTok from supporting Hamas to supporting Osama bin Laden,"" Maher said in his opening monologue. ""Is this the Tide pods? Is this the eating the Tide... is this where this is coming from? Are their minds literally poisoned now?"" He was referencing the viral and dangerous TikTok challenge from several years back, where teens dared each other to eat Tide pods. Maher's comments come after several Jewish celebrities, including Sacha Baron Cohen, Debra Messing and Amy Schumer, criticized the social media app following a surge of antisemitic rhetoric going viral on TikTok after Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel. It has also led to some young people supporting bin Laden. According to The New York Times, more than 30 influential people had a confrontational call with TikTok executives earlier in the week, where Cohen at one point declared on the call, ""What is happening at TikTok is it is creating the biggest antisemitic movement since the Nazis. Shame on you."" Later on Friday's Real Time episode, Maher brought up TikTok again during a panel discussion with Donna Brazile, a Georgetown University professor and award-winning media contributor to ABC News, USA Today and The Hill, and former Illinois Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger. The host went on to read a line from a Washington Post story, which said that by Wednesday night, bin Laden's ""Letter to America,"" had ""become a point of discussion among left-wing creators on the video app, with some saying its critiques of American foreign policy had opened their eyes to a history they'd never learned."" ""Yeah, they didn't learn any history. That's the problem. So now you're gonna get it from bin Laden,"" Maher said in response. ""bin Laden, really?"" ""It is a failure of parenting. It's a failure of the education system, that to tell people how evil this stuff is. And there's something with TikTok,"" Kinzinger added. ""This is a serious national security threat when you have young Americans saying that bin Laden is getting it right and our own foreign policy is wrong because of whatever reasons they've come up with. This is a serious issue."" Brazile proceeded to chime in, saying she's ""surprised that social media companies have not gotten smart about how algorithms are used,"" adding, ""It is used to sort of like pipe up and amplify the most incendiary thing out there. And the fact that young people don't know right from wrong, good from evil."" Though the episode the week before Thanksgiving is typically Maher's last Real Time episode of the fall season, the host said the it will continue into December since the season was delayed due to the writers strike.

"March 7, 2024",BOOK REVIEW; Is social media dulling your taste?; Kyle Chayka's book 'Filterworld' claims algorithmic curation kills creative agency.,54,"  Partway through Kyle Chayka's new book, ""Filterworld,"" about how digital algorithms transform culture, a quote from one of his subjects stopped me cold. Valerie Peter, a younger woman interviewed for the book, had never liked legwarmers. But in late 2021, legwarmers became a pervasive fashion trend on Instagram, TikTok and Pinterest. She felt compelled to buy a pair. The decision felt almost subconscious, disturbingly so. It were as if clout-chasing influencers and surveillance-based digital advertising had somehow corrupted her self-identity. ""I just want to know that what I like is what I actually like,"" Peter said. Good luck, I thought. I pictured the ending from Alex Garland's 2018 sci-fi film ""Annihilation,"" where Natalie Portman's character, Lena, confronts a faceless extraterrestrial that mimics, with growing violence, her every move. It's the strange dance of today's surveillance economy: Users give platforms data, which platforms use to adapt to the user (and sell more precisely targeted ads), which in turn better adapts the user to the platform. Every algorithm-driven platform is an alien lifeforce that acts more like you over time, even if it's enabling your belief in a conspiracy theory or dangerously reinforcing a depressive episode. ""Algorithmic recommendations are addictive because they are always subtly confirming your own cultural, political, and social biases, warping your surroundings into a mirror image of yourself while doing the same for everyone else,"" Chayka writes. ""This had made me anxious, the possibility that my view of my own life -- lived through the Internet -- was a fiction formed by the feeds."" So he went on an algorithm cleanse and quit social media, going cranky from the cognitive withdrawal at first. He read David Brooks out of sheer boredom. Took fewer photos. Gained clarity. In ""Filterworld,"" Chayka, a writer who covers technology and internet culture for the New Yorker, uses taste as the primary lens through which to explore this cycle of adaptation and alienation that now defines our encounters with many tech platforms. Chayka's view is that the proliferation of recommendation algorithms on services like Netflix, Spotify and TikTok since the 2010s have created a cultural world that's flatter, more homogenous and more passively consumed. The book is part of a long-building, now-maturing backlash against the uncanny mental world, our world, that the tech industry has built over the last two decades. ""In place of the human gatekeepers and curators of culture, the editors and DJs, we now have a set of algorithmic gatekeepers,"" Chayka writes. ""While this shift has lowered many cultural barriers to entry, since anyone can make their work public online, it has also resulted in a kind of tyranny of real-time data. Attention becomes the only metric by which culture is judged, and what gets attention is dictated by equations developed by Silicon Valley engineers."" If taste -- aesthetic judgment -- is a human skill cultivated by a lifetime of gazing, reading, listening and selecting, recommendation algorithms are like the new robots powering up to take over the assembly line of our intentionality. These mathematical helpers reduce selection time and boost the efficiency of seeing pictures, watching TV shows and hearing songs: more and faster. Meanwhile, the humans who used to browse the shelves in libraries or at Blockbusters become button-pushers a little less good at looking around. No need to stress over finding the right album for your mood anymore. Just listen to this Spotify playlist of lo-fi beats to relax to. Whenever your environment gets automated, you become a little more of an automatic person. ""There are 'lean-in' moments, when the user is paying attention, choosing what to consume and actively judging the result,"" Chayka writes of active and passive modes of content consumption on platforms. ""And there are 'lean-back' moments, when users coast along with content running in the background, not worrying too much about what it is or what plays next. Algorithmic recommendations push us toward the latter category, in which we are fed culture like foie-gras ducks, with more regard for volume than quality -- because volume, sheer time spent, is what makes money for the platform through targeted advertising."" Time to rebel! I for one, as a former English major, am vulnerable to humanities-based arguments of decline; our lives (or at least our moods) might improve modestly if we went around smashing a few more machines. Nonetheless, Chayka's version of taste is an unreliable instrument for establishing the extent that Big Tech is achromatizing the last bit of color out of our souls. A much older cultural anxiety is also afoot here. Chayka defines taste as an elevated subjectivity, a way you consciously place yourself both within and against the world: ""We make constant decisions to listen to, read, or wear one thing instead of another. These choices are intimate, reflecting our ephemeral moods and the slow building of our individual sensibilities -- of our senses of self. ... Taste is a word for how we measure culture and judge our relationship to it."" Taste is how you discriminate, in the most neutral sense of that word. But later, the emphasis on taste, a capacity theoretically any human has, shifts toward good taste, a quality of the few rather than the many: ""When taste is too standardized, it is degraded. ... Consumption without taste is just undiluted, accelerated capitalism."" A whiff of social status drifts in: ""There are two forces forming our tastes ... the first is our independent pursuit of what we individually enjoy, while the second is our awareness of what it appears that most other people like, the dominant mainstream. The two may move in opposite directions, but it's often easier to follow the latter, particularly when the Internet makes what other people are consuming so immediately."" So if everyone else is jumping off the bridge of Sony's Marvelmovie ""Madame Web"" (12% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, 57% audience score), you don't have to follow them. Go listen to some 12-tone Schoenberg string quartets and commune with God, and your selfhood will remain secure. But Chayka's valid analysis of how algorithmic curation dulls our creative agency overlaps messily with the centuries-old anxiety of the aesthete within modernity, where all subjective opinions are ultimately equal, never moreso than in the marketplace. ""These days the fee even for authors of repute is very small, whereas the tips dropped to the literary hacks are very considerable,"" Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard bemoaned in 1846. What the internet performs, and what platforms perfect, is an occult crowd summoning that illustrates just how outnumbered and irrelevant the snob really is. Picture the food critic from ""Ratatouille,"" Anton Ego, standing amid the biggest never-ending Black Friday mall crush in human history, and you've got an idea of how it feels to create a Substack newsletter in 2024 to write some literary essays for the web. This particular flattening effect of platforms comes less from the rise of manipulative algorithmic whizbangery than the sheer presence of other people and the consumer purchasing power they represent . ""In the place of physical hotels and airports, we have Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok as spaces of congregation that erase differences,"" Chayka writes. ""There is now also the generic global consumer, whose preferences and desires are molded more by the platforms they use than where they live."" Access to a massive global market, combined with powerful analytics and social media feedback effects, create ever-more powerful incentives for even genius creatives to give the crowd the mush it wants. Rotten Tomatoes is one of those places where you can still watch the old culture fight the new in a grotesque pit. (Isn't my love for romantic schlock like 1997's ""The Saint,"" starring Val Kilmer in an absurd number of disguises, just as valid as the British Film Institute's adoration of ""Jeanne Dielman, 23, quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles"" as the greatest film of all time?) The review-aggregation website has different percentages to measure the mood of the experts versus the mood of the masses, kind of like a weather forecast that tells you what kind of class warfare the new ""Spider-Man"" is unleashing this week. ""The behavior of these social media hordes represents an anti-democratic, anti-intellectual mind-set that is harmful to the cause of art and antithetical to the spirit of movies,"" longtime New York Times film critic A.O. Scott bemoaned in a farewell essay explaining why he was leaving film criticism. ""Fan culture is rooted in conformity, obedience, group identity and mob behavior, and its rise mirrors and models the spread of intolerant, authoritarian, aggressive tendencies in our politics and our communal life."" So let's say all this consumer unthinkingness and the enclosure of new intellectual possibilities is incipient fascism. Unplug to end the alien dance and go find yourself: the authentic you, away from the data surveillance, away from the crowds. It will almost certainly be more restful, as Chayka found. But trying to find some neighborhood of your city that hasn't been impacted in some way by an internet platform is like searching for a corner of Earth untouched by climate change. Google and Waze have changed cities' traffic patterns; Yelp directs eaters to some restaurants over others, influencing which ones close and which survive; Spotify playlists are running in the the restaurant you picked; TikTok fashion trends are reflected in the clothes of the people you see; people have transformed their own faces in pursuit of homogenous Instagram beauty standards. The digital is the real. Recommendation algorithms, the companies that control them and the crowds that use them have already re-created the world. What matters most isn't an unattainable sense of individual authenticity -- you're not some Philip K. Dick cyborg who can sync up and cycle back to factory settings, purging the hard drive to compress yourself just small enough to slip through the firewall of human history. What's achievable for proper people is a better collective competency about what the platform economy does to us and what it wants us to do next. That's when we can choose to do something different, if we want. Call it a matter of taste. -- Filterworld By Kyle Chayka Doubleday Books: 304 pages, $28 Graphic    PHOTO: (no caption) PHOTOGRAPHER:Didem Mente Anadolu via Getty Images PHOTO: (no caption) PHOTOGRAPHER: Doubleday PHOTO: AUTHOR Kyle Chayka.

"March 1, 2024",BTS Fans Demand HYBE Fire Scooter Braun Over Pro-Israel Views,55,"  Fans of BTS have pleaded with the K-pop band's management company HYBE to fire Scooter Braun, the CEO of HYBE-America, for his pro-Israel views amid the war in Gaza. The Korea Times reported on Wednesday that some BTS fans, commonly known as the ARMY, reacted to a speech Braun delivered in Israel in December that called for the return of the hostages taken during the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas.  On Feb. 23, according to local media reports, a group of BTS fans hired an electronic billboard truck and sent it to HYBE's headquarters in central Seoul. ""Korean and International ARMY demand HYBE divests from Zionism and Zionists in the industry,"" the message displayed on the truck said in both English and Korean alongside clips of devastation from the war in Gaza.  The message continued, ""If our demands are not met, ARMY will continue to push for you to meet our demands. Do not look away when the same thing that happened to your Korean ancestors is happening to Palestinians. We ask that you stand for humanity, for the right side of history and against violence."" Btw i think this is the last day the truck will be parked at hybe SO YALL NEED TO TREND #????????????? #HYBEDivestFromZionism AND SPAM KMEDIAAAAAAAAA pic.twitter.com/UgVnbyIPXO - Miriam FESTA? ( face ) (@hobiriam) February 24, 2024 On social media, BTS fans have pushed hashtags such as #HYBEDivestFromZionism to raise awareness of their campaign to oust Braun. Fans have also intimated that they will stop purchasing music and merchandise related to HYBE and its artists unless the label accedes to their demands. BTS fans have long been known for their online activism, particularly on X, Instagram and TikTok. The band's supporters are vocal supporters of the Black Lives Matter and other social justice movements, and also played a small role in disrupting Donald Trump's 2020 reelection campaign, including falsely ordering tickets to Trump's rallies, so that the attendances would be lower than expected or cancelled outright. The Korea Times reports that HYBE addressed Braun's speech in a statement that said, ""It is a personal statement that is separate from company management."" Although, the label has yet to address the demands made by BTS fans via the truck messages. The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to HYBE and reps for Scooter Braun for further comment.  as long as scooter braun is involved with future projects of hybe artists, I will not be purchasing any albums, merch, or other related content. #HYBEDivestFromZionism #????????????? #freepalestine pic.twitter.com/4g2Zc7kfwh - randi? (@bts_trology) February 29, 2024 HYBE, formerly known as Big Hit Entertainment, acquired Braun's Ithaca Holdings in 2021, a deal that would later see the American music mogul become CEO of HYBE-America.  In that December speech in Tel Aviv, Braun said his grandmother was a survivor of Auschwitz and that he ""had to come and stand with my people."" He added he had spoken with some of the survivors of the Supernova rave, where over 360 people were killed on Oct. 7 by Hamas.  Feb. 29, 10:13 p.m. A previous version of this story incorrectly said Scooter Braun's December speech in Israel was in support of the war in Gaza, it was about the return of hostages.

"December 31, 2023",BUSINESS; Flip app puts a price tag on your contacts; Social shopping network bets on cash and honest reviews in hopes of securing purchase,56,"  Want to know how much your friends are worth? Meet Flip, the shopping app that will put a price tag on every single person in your phone's contact list. Cajole one of them into signing up for the app, and you get cash -- up to $130 per person -- to spend on Flip. ""The crazy thing is people are worth different amounts of money if you successfully get them on the app,"" said Lily Goldfarb, 27, a Flip user from Silver Lake. ""I had one friend who was only worth, like, $25. It was really so sad."" In some circles, this referral challenge has created a frenzied bounty hunt for one's most valuable friends. And it has earned Flip a moment of buzz, a valuable currency in the competitive landscape of social shopping. Some estimates put the app's total downloads at around 2 million. El Segundo-based Flip, which sells an array of products from hip direct-to-consumer brands to snack foods, is pitching itself as a rare marketplace where customers can trust product reviews, and it's willing to pay big bucks in user acquisition costs to get this vision up and running. The referral game is only one way the app compensates users. Flip, which officially launched some six months ago, will pay you for commenting on video product reviews and even just passively swiping through the app's TikTok-style feed of seemingly endless content. If you review a product, you get a cut of the app's ad revenue -- no matter if the review is positive or negative. Is Flip offering something that's too good to last? Probably. Enabling consumerism on a whole new scale? Likely. And yet -- it might be better than the status quo. At the very least, Flip is aiming to respond to the ills of today's online shopping landscape: fake reviews, discrepancies between product photos and what arrives on your doorstep, and influencers endorsing mediocre products with unwarranted enthusiasm. The company is promising another way to shop, one where the consumer should feel like the winner. -- The addictive allure of the bounty hunt It's easy to be swept up in the cash grab of Flip's referral game. Each user's potential earnings are shown in a thermometer-style graphic on the app: names of your phone contacts are shown next to their ""worth,"" and the total value of your possible winnings is front and center. For many users, this number is tens of thousands of dollars. Goldfarb, who works at a nonprofit, was initially wary when a friend sent her a $75 referral coupon to join Flip, but it was hard to say no to, as she called it, ""free money."" Upon seeing the $75 in her account, the former skeptic was transformed. Goldfarb quickly became one of the most avid Flip users among her friends. In November, she earned nearly $850 from referring 14 people to the app, including her mom. She spent the cash on skin care, hair products and kitchen supplies. Flip's founder keeps close to the vest how the company determines the value of your friends, but many have noticed that Flip syncs with a user's phone contacts, and those with more friends already on Flip command higher referral bonuses. Lena Renshaw, 25, a software engineer and business school student who lives in Brooklyn, has earned close to $1,000 in referral bounties. The most she earned from one referral was $100. ""It was definitely my most popular, cool friend,"" she said. But the most valuable contact Renshaw saw was a surprising one: her driver's ed teacher from high school. ""She had all of these students' numbers saved throughout the history of time, which I thought was funny,"" Renshaw said. She used her winnings to outfit her kitchen with products from Flip -- plates, cups, silverware, a lemon squeezer and Tupperware. She also bought books and a projector that makes her room look like a planetarium. -- Come for cash, stay for anti-influencer reviews ""The whole concept of Flip is, how do we build honesty around commerce?"" said Noor Agha, the app's co-founder. For starters, the company eliminated five-star product rankings, which are increasingly easy to fake on the internet. Instead, users flick through review videos before adding an item to their cart, using the same addictive thumb scroll as TikTok and Instagram Reels. Unlike TikTok and Reels, product reviews on Flip are mostly made by everyday people, not professional influencers being paid thousands. Brands are banned from sponsoring video reviews. And everyone engaging in the process -- from creators to viewers to commenters -- can make a few bucks along the way. ""Who do you trust more: Flip or the brand? Or the person that bought it before you?"" Agha said. Flip assumes that when you incentivize everyone to give the pros and cons in their product testimonials in exchange for a little cash, you'll get an honest space online. ""If everything is positive,"" Agha said, ""it means everything is a lie."" The company is betting this value proposition will set it apart from rivals, like TikTok Shop, which already has a built-in audience; TikTok has 150 million U.S. users, and teens spend an average of nearly two hours a day using the app. TikTok Shop is teeming with product-pitching influencers, many of whom have discovered they can earn enough commissions to make reviews a serious side gig. Flip reviewers automatically earn money, with the amount varying based on the engagement a video gets. Brands cannot pay creators to make content, and the app pays all creators the same rates, regardless of follower count. These earnings are a cut of Flip's advertising revenue, although the company is not yet profitable. (""It's still early days,"" Agha said, adding that Flip has roughly 150 advertisers so far.) ""I saw a lot of people making video reviews for products they had gotten being like, 'this is terrible,' "" Renshaw said. ""I thought that was unique about the app and something that you wouldn't find on Instagram."" This is a new phase in the influencer ecosystem, said Blake Michael, a partner at CreatorLed Ventures, a venture firm for influencers. The first phase was the original mommy bloggers -- genuine people who accidentally blew up online. The second phase was professional creators -- those who set out to make a living shilling products. ""I think today we're seeing the third step. ... People are a little bit more skeptical to trust these people who are just famous for being famous, and they would much rather just hear from a real, normal person,"" he said. Earnings for creators on Flip can vary. One user posted a video review that attracted about 5,000 unique views and seven comments, earning her $31 in three days. Another earned far less -- $13 in a month from three video reviews that attracted almost 4,000 cumulative views. Agha claims some super users earn between $5,000 and $10,000 a month. That cash either can be applied to in-app purchases or directly deposited into one's bank account. Users can also accrue small amounts for watching, liking and commenting on videos, a few cents per action. That revenue can only be credited to in-app orders. The real question is whether all of this cash really does buy legitimacy for a new marketplace up against sizable competitors. Not everyone is sold. ""It was really hard to gain people's trust with it,"" said Uma Bates, 28, a copywriter and fiction writer who lives in New York. ""I think that convincing them that [the app] was legitimate and that their information wasn't going to be stolen was an incredibly hard thing to do, and I can't say that I convinced many people to use it, just a few here and there."" -- The fuzzy economics amid big competition Flip is funding this endeavor so far with $95 million in venture capital backing. The company closed a $60-million Series B funding round last summer led by WestCap, according to a company press release. Mubadala Capital and Streamlined Ventures also participated in the funding round. Flip said it is currently focused on expanding its product offerings. ""I promise you between now and the next three months, you will start seeing everything,"" Agha said. ""And by June, there shouldn't be anything that you want to buy that you can't find on Flip."" The task is made easier by the company's main distribution model: dropshipping. Brands handle their own shipping, and Flip handles the less capital-intensive business of customer service and returns. (The company will manage some brands' shipping for an extra fee, but fewer than 5% have chosen that option.) Even though Flip seems flush with cash, the startup's costly user acquisition strategy -- and gamified sign-up process -- is worrying some in the VC space. ""I just don't know how long that's going to last, especially if their product market fit revolves around people basically getting paid to use the app,"" Michael said. Larger rivals TikTok Shop, Amazon Inspire and Instagram Reels all have a massive head start in the social shopping space. Michael also wonders how many users will be willing to transition away from using their referral bounties to using their own money. Agha dismisses the skepticism. ""Our job is to add the products, deliver the best e-commerce service, and people [will] talk to each other,"" Agha said. ""Whether it's positive or negative, you get paid."" Uncertainty about its future aside, this much is true: Flip is offering something hard to come by these days in the noisy and often dystopian world of social media -- fun. ""I noticed that whenever I would invite somebody who had a much higher bounty, I would not be the first to be texting them,"" Michael said. ""[They'd] be like, 'Blake, 20 other people have texted me about this,' "" he said. The bounty hunt continues.

"March 14, 2024",BUSINESS; House passes bill to ban TikTok unless Chinese-based owner divests,57,"  The House on Wednesday passed a bill that would lead to a nationwide ban on the popular video app TikTok if its China-based owner doesn't sell, as lawmakers acted on concerns that the company's current ownership structure is a national security threat. The bill, passed by a vote of 352 to 65, now goes to the Senate, where its prospects are unclear. TikTok, which has more than 150 million American users, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd. The lawmakers contend that ByteDance is beholden to the Chinese government, which could demand access to the data of TikTok users in the U.S. any time it wants. The worry stems from a set of Chinese national security laws that compel organizations to assist with intelligence gathering. ""We have given TikTok a clear choice,"" said Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-Wash.). ""Separate from your parent company ByteDance, which is beholden to the CCP [the Chinese Communist Party], and remain operational in the United States, or side with the CCP and face the consequences. The choice is TikTok's."" House passage of the bill is only the first step. The Senate would also need to pass the measure, and lawmakers in that chamber indicated it would undergo a thorough review. Senate Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he'll have to consult with relevant committee chairs to determine the bill's path. President Biden has said if Congress passes the measure, he will sign it. The House vote is the latest example of increased tensions between China and the U.S. By targeting TikTok, lawmakers are tackling what they see as a grave threat to America's national security -- but also singling out a platform popular with millions of people, many of whom skew younger, just months before an election. A TikTok spokesperson, Alex Haurek, said in a statement after the vote that the bill was jammed through as part of a secretive process. ""We are hopeful that the Senate will consider the facts, listen to their constituents, and realize the impact on the economy, 7 million small businesses, and the 170 million Americans who use our service,"" Haurek said. Overall, 197 Republican lawmakers voted for the measure and 15 against. On the Democratic side, 155 voted for the bill and 50 against. Opposition to the bill was also bipartisan. Some Republicans said the U.S. should warn consumers if there are data privacy and propaganda concerns, while some Democrats voiced concerns about the effect a ban would have on millions of users in the U.S., many of whom are entrepreneurs and business owners. ""The answer to authoritarianism is not more authoritarianism,"" said Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Elk Grove). ""The answer to CCP-style propaganda is not CCP-style oppression. Let us slow down before we blunder down this very steep and slippery slope."" TikTok has long denied that it could be used as a tool of the Chinese government. The company has said it has never shared U.S. user data with Chinese authorities and won't do so if it is asked. To date, the U.S. government also has not provided any evidence that TikTok shared such information with Chinese authorities. Ahead of the House vote, a top national security official in the Biden administration held a closed-door briefing Tuesday with lawmakers to discuss TikTok and the national security implications. Lawmakers are balancing those security concerns against a desire not to limit free speech online. ""What we've tried to do here is be very thoughtful and deliberate about the need to force a divestiture of TikTok without granting any authority to the executive branch to regulate content or go after any American company,"" said Rep. Mike Gallagher, the bill's author. The security briefing seemed to change few minds, instead solidifying the views of both sides. ""We have a national security obligation to prevent America's most strategic adversary from being so involved in our lives,"" said Rep. Nick LaLota (R-N.Y.). But Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Long Beach) said no information has been shared with him that convinces him TikTok is a national security threat. ""My opinion, leaving that briefing, has not changed at all,"" he said. ""This idea that we're going to ban, essentially, entrepreneurs, small business owners, the main way how young people actually communicate with each other is to me insane,"" Garcia said. ""Not a single thing that we heard in today's classified briefing was unique to TikTok. It was things that happen on every single social media platform,"" said Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-San Diego). Republican leaders have moved quickly to bring up the bill after its introduction last week. A House committee approved the legislation unanimously, even after their offices were inundated with calls from TikTok users demanding they drop the effort. Some offices even shut off their phones because of the onslaught. Lawmakers in both parties are anxious to confront China on a range of issues. The House formed a special committee to focus on China-related issues. And Schumer directed committee chairs to begin working with Republicans on a bipartisan China competition bill. Senators are expressing an openness to the bill but suggested they don't want to rush ahead. ""It is not for me a redeeming quality that you're moving very fast in technology because the history shows you make a lot of mistakes,"" said Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). In pushing ahead with the legislation, House Republicans are also creating rare daylight between themselves and former President Trump as he seeks another term in the White House. Trump has voiced opposition to the effort. He said Monday that he still believes TikTok poses a national security risk but is opposed to banning the hugely popular app because doing so would help its rival, Facebook, which he continues to lambast over his 2020 election loss. As president, Trump attempted to ban TikTok through an executive order that called ""the spread in the United States of mobile applications developed and owned by companies in the People's Republic of China"" a threat to ""the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States."" The courts, however, blocked the action after TikTok sued, arguing that such actions would violate free speech and due process rights.

"January 13, 2024",BUSINESS; How to make money as an influencer in 2024; What creator economy's growth means for your earning potential,58,"  Half a trillion dollars. That's how large the creator economy, currently pegged at $250 billion, is predicted to grow in the next four years, according to Goldman Sachs. While people have been making a living off of creating content for online audiences for nearly two decades, what was once a nascent industry is growing up. Brands are getting more strategic about influencer marketing, a thriving ecosystem has emerged to serve creators and their needs, and social platforms are increasingly nudging consumers to spend while they scroll. What does this mean for influencers and their audiences? The Times asked those who have been in the creator economy for decades to opine on what the new year will bring. We're still in the early innings, they said, but in 2024, the industry will continue to mature in significant ways. -- It will get tougher to build a 'real' business. Most creators start off as one-man bands. They brainstorm, film, edit and post content on their own. Day by day, they grow their followings, and eventually begin to make money. But then what? ""There are two options: You either bring in a manager or agent externally, or you hire a COO or business partner internally,"" said Jon Youshaei, a creator and founder of Youshaei Studios. ""And more and more, I'm seeing creators bring in a right-hand person internally."" A lot of this has to do with competition. Although the barrier to entry has never been lower, building a ""real business"" in the creator economy is getting harder, Youshaei said. Blake Michael, chief strategy officer of Fourteen Media Group, a consulting firm for creator economy startups, said this necessitates bringing in outsiders to help with growth strategies. ""Niche verticals are so quickly becoming saturated, and that means you've got to put more effort into your content to stand out,"" Michael said. -- Companies will be more selective about who they work with ... In the early days of influencer marketing, creators quickly attracted money and attention from companies clamoring to get in on social media. This year, businesses won't be as willing to throw money at any influencer that comes their way. ""I just think they're getting a lot smarter,"" said Joe Gagliese, co-founder of Viral Nation, one of the world's first influencer marketing agencies. ""They want to understand: Does this person really align with my brand? What are their views and perspectives on things that might not align with my brand?"" As brands become more disciplined in their efforts in 2024, they will increasingly want to see results they can measure, Gagliese said. Two influencers who may look the same on paper might produce completely different results. Companies are learning to look at metrics such as community engagement over number of followers, and they're scrutinizing the type of relationships creators have with their audience. ""There's creators who people look to and trust for their opinion, and then there's creators who folks like to be entertained by,"" Gagliese said, ""and those two types of engagement are very different as it relates to being able to help a brand."" -- ... But this could mean more opportunities for 'micro influencers.' Counterintuitively, the push to formalize channels of influencer marketing will mean more opportunities for creators with smaller followings. Traditionally, several ""inefficiencies"" have slowed down the process when companies want to work with influencers, said Zach Ferraro, head of strategic partnerships at Fourthwall, a platform that helps creators sell products and launch memberships. First, brands had to look for the right creator -- and often they didn't know exactly what they were looking for or what to expect realistically in terms of outcomes, Ferraro said. They had to go back and forth with a manager on rates, which can vary widely, and provide deliverables, such as a certain number of Instagram posts or videos. To make it worth the friction and costs involved, brands would look only to ink larger deals. But as companies have become more experienced, platforms that connect creators with brands have proliferated and the process has become more transparent. For example, the company F*** You Pay Me, allows creators to anonymously review brands they've worked with and share how much they got paid. ""Smaller, mid-tier micro influencers are going to get more opportunities as friction goes down,"" Ferraro said. Gagliese of Viral Nation agrees. ""I think that creators who have really developed core audiences and communities and have the ability to convert and create those business outcomes will likely get paid more,"" he said. These are the influencers who might not have millions of followers but boast smaller, devoted audiences. Another possibility is for brands to hire smaller creators for in-house content, Ferraro said. ""Middle-class"" creators who might not be doing as well financially as they want to be could find opportunities offering their expertise to brands looking to build their audiences. -- Consumers will pay you for your content too. With the advent of in-app ""tipping"" features on social platforms, creators have another way to make money: Their fans can pay them directly without going through a third-party platform, such as Patreon or Buy Me a Coffee. On TikTok, users can purchase coins to spend on virtual gifts for livestreamers on the platform that can then be converted into earnings. The most popular form of spending is a $19.99 bundle of coins that makes up a quarter of the app's in-app purchase revenue (TikTok takes 50% of the payout). Lexi Sydow, head of insights at data.ai, said this is a compelling trend because they represent one-off microtransactions given in the moment for specific creators that consumers enjoy. ""There's not necessarily a subscription tied to it,"" Sydow said. ""You're saying, 'Kudos. I like this. I want more of it.' And I think that that's powerful for this space because I really do believe we're in the early days of the growth rates."" In 2023, TikTok became the first non-game app to generate $10 billion in consumer spending, according to data.ai. This bodes well for social media spending overall, which is only projected to grow. Other platforms such as Instagram and YouTube have also jumped on the bandwagon to introduce tipping features. -- Authenticity will rule ... Eric Wei, co-founder of Karat, a startup that helps creators with their finances and credit, describes the current era of social media content as ""sensationalist"" -- and predicts a trend toward authenticity in 2024. Just take a look at the top subscribed YouTube channel by an individual, MrBeast, whose recent videos include ""I Rescued 100 Abandoned Dogs!"" and ""$1 vs $100,000,000 Car!"" Although MrBeast will continue to be popular, Wei predicts a movement of creators toward more unedited content. They include fitness YouTuber Sam Sulek, who has 2.75 million subscribers. ""Everyone's focusing on Sam, why? The guy doesn't edit,"" Wei said. ""It's just him working out at the gym for over an hour."" Youshaei, who also has a YouTube channel, said he sees the rise of this kind of content counteracting the ""hyper-edited"" videos that have taken over YouTube in recent years. -- ... But the rise of fake influencers is coming. Lil Miquela, self-described as a ""19-year-old Robot living in LA,"" is one of the first virtual influencers. She charges up to hundreds of thousands of dollars for a deal and has worked with brands such as Burberry, Prada and Givenchy, the Financial Times reported. She posts photos of herself vacationing in Europe, dyeing her hair at the salon and eating at taquerias. Does it matter that she's not real? She has 2.6 million followers. Human influencers may soon have to worry about competition from such AI-generated avatars. Digital avatars that amass followers is not a new idea. Consider Japanese Vocaloid Hatsune Miku and K/DA, a virtual K-pop girl group featuring League of Legends characters. And Wei points to Iron Mouse, one of the most subscribed female creators on Twitch who uses a virtual avatar and is known as a VTuber. ""It's already a billion-dollar industry,"" he said.

"February 23, 2024",BUSINESS; Jobless claims fall again as market powers on,59,"  The number of Americans applying for jobless benefits fell to its lowest level in five weeks, even as more high-profile companies announce layoffs. Applications for unemployment benefits fell to 201,000, down 12,000, for the week that ended Feb. 17, the Labor Department reported Thursday. The four-week average of claims, a less volatile measure, fell to 215,250, down 3,500 from the previous week. Weekly unemployment claims are broadly viewed as representative of the number of U.S. layoffs in a given week. They have remained at historically low levels in recent years, despite efforts by the U.S. Federal Reserve to cool the economy. The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark borrowing rate 11 times beginning in March 2022 in an effort to bring down the four-decade-high inflation that took hold after the economy roared back from the COVID-19 recession of 2020. Many economists expected the rapid rate hikes to weaken the labor market and potentially tip the country into recession, but that hasn't happened. Jobs have remained plentiful and the economy has held up better than forecast thanks to strong consumer spending. U.S. employers delivered a stunning burst of hiring to begin 2024, adding 353,000 jobs in January in the latest sign of the economy's continuing ability to shrug off high interest rates. Last month's job gain -- roughly twice what economists had predicted -- topped the December gain of 333,000, a figure that was revised sharply higher. The unemployment rate stayed at 3.7%, and has been below 4% for 24 straight months, the longest such streak since the 1960s. Though layoffs remain at low levels, there has been an uptick in job cuts recently across technology and media. Google parent company Alphabet, EBay, TikTok, Snap and the Los Angeles Times have all recently announced layoffs. Last week, Cisco Systems announced it was cutting 4,000 jobs. Outside of tech and media, UPS, Macy's and Levi's also recently cut jobs. In total, 1.86 million Americans were collecting jobless benefits during the week that ended Feb. 10, a decrease of 27,000 from the previous week. Though inflation has eased considerably in the last year, the Labor Department reported last week that prices remain well above the Fed's 2% target.

"December 10, 2023","BUSINESS; TikTok: QVC for Gen Z; Creators have flooded the platform's in-app shopping feature with product testimonials. Affable, urgent, earnest -- they're proving remarkably effective.",60,"  As I was scrolling through TikTok the other day, I received a text from a friend. ""I take back everything bad I said about TikTok Shop,"" she said. ""I just bought a Staub Dutch oven for like $100. And it's normally like $400."" I had no idea what a Dutch oven is used for, but I thought I might need one too. I mean, I had to at least check -- the deal was too good to be true. Thankfully, I came to my senses and did not buy one. But I did spend almost $100 on other items from TikTok Shop that day. Ever since TikTok officially launched its in-app shopping feature in the U.S. in September, it's quickly turned the video-scrolling app into a budding e-commerce marketplace. The new feature sells about $7 million worth of products a day in the U.S., with a goal of reaching $10 million a day by the end of the year, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. Although TikTok Shop has a ways to go before it can truly match up to the likes of e-commerce giant Amazon in terms of sheer volume, customer trust and delivery logistics, what it does have is unparalleled command over eyeballs. TikTok has 150 million users in the U.S., 35% of whom are ages 18 to 24. Teens in particular spend an average of nearly two hours a day on the app. And TikTok Shop is proving to be remarkably effective at turning that screen time into shopping time. -- Psychological warfare It's impossible to spend any amount of time on TikTok these days without encountering an ad or a video that has a product linked for commission. And not just any product. I routinely see the same slew of items -- specifically targeted to blend into my feed of fashion, mental health and art content -- over, and over, and over again until I could practically market them myself. A brown faux leather shoulder bag, big enough to carry someone's laptop, a few books, phone, wallet. The Beachwaver, a rotating curling iron that will curl your hair in minutes. A shadow work journal to help you heal your inner child. The OQQ three-piece women's body suit that will snatch your waist, even if you just gave birth. A 100-color watercolor set that comes with 35 metallic colors and three water brush pens. Repetition as a promotional strategy is nothing new, but on TikTok Shop it feels like a form of psychological warfare. I'm losing the battle -- or at least my credit card is. This endless onslaught of product videos is being generated by a growing number of creators who almost exclusively focus on recommendation or review videos. They talk directly into the camera while unboxing or trying out a new product. They're chatty and affable, and they seem like regular people who are genuinely recommending something they've found useful or enjoyable in their everyday lives. Now one video on its own isn't going to persuade me to buy something, but scrolling through 10 or 20 videos featuring real-life testimonials about the same product might be enough to get me to cave. ""This is the toner that was ranked No. 1 in Korea for months and months and months and months,"" a woman tells me knowingly, her hair freshly wet from the shower and two white toner pad squares on her face. ""When I was in Korea I stocked up back in March."" She held up a bottle that I had already seen recommended by two other accounts. All three women had smooth, shiny plump skin -- the kind of skin that stays tantalizingly out of reach for me. Los Angeles creator Dina Asprer said she doesn't consider herself an ""influencer"" or a ""TikTok person"" but had always been passionate about Korean skincare, having lived in South Korea for five years after college. The 31-year-old quit her banking job during the pandemic to spend more time with her kids and only made TikToks for fun. She started putting links to products in her videos in June when the option became available to some users. One particular item took off -- a snail mucin essence from popular Korean brand COSRX. At one point, she was earning commissions from selling 600 bottles a day, and now still sells around 1,000 bottles a month. ""I never considered this as a job, but I'm starting to take it more seriously,"" Asprer said. She's even attended a few workshops that TikTok offers to help creators grow, traveling to its office in Culver City. In another video that pops up on my feed, a woman demands my attention. ""Listen to me,"" Katelyn Beaupre says urgently. ""If you have eczema or dry skin, I'm about to put you on."" I don't have either, but for some reason, this information feels important to know. Beaupre explains that she works at a daycare and has OCD, which means her hands are extremely dry from washing them frequently. Other products made her hands greasy, but this one -- which she purchased after seeing it all over TikTok -- was so good she was bringing it in for her co-workers to try. ""I was a little skeptical at first because I really didn't like the smell,"" Beaupre says. ""To me, it smells like oregano."" That video, featuring a lotion by the brand the Ocean Healed My Eczema, has 3.6 million views. She posted about it a few more times. Last month, she made about $20,000 in commissions. The 22-year-old from Massachusetts has a little more than 95,000 followers on TikTok and makes videos when she has time, outside of working at a preschool full time and going to school part time. But the commissions she's earned in the last two months have helped her to pay off her credit card debt and student loans. Commissions range from 20 cents to $7 a purchase and can fluctuate if a certain product, like the rotating curling iron, for example, starts trending, leading to more influencers making videos about it, Beaupre noticed. ""Sometimes I try to go for things that are a little bit higher in commission,"" she said. She also indicates in her profile that she's a ""UGC + lifestyle creator,"" which means her videos are available for companies to use as user-generated content in paid TikTok ads. The eczema lotion that Beaupre promoted first offered a $4.99 commission, or 20% of the price, before the amount was lowered to closer to $3. Maybe that's why there are countless other videos of creators raving about the very same product. Yet they still feel honest. People showed before-and-after pictures of their hands, legs and elbows, some using it for eczema and dry hands and others for psoriasis. The company has made it simple for sellers to make products eligible for commission and creators to request free products and post videos with a direct link to generate sales, streamlining a process that otherwise might have required more business savvy from both sides. TikTok Shop has just two requirements for commission-eligible creators: You must be over 18 and have at least 5,000 followers. -- Selling via livestream Every week, Brandon Hurst sells more than 1,200 plants from his 800-square-foot apartment in Van Nuys. He carefully packages each one -- golden pothos, string of hearts, trailing hoya -- with a small team of employees, slaps on a bright sticker that reads ""live plants,"" and ships them across the country. Then the next batch arrives at his apartment, ready to be sold. His secret? Live selling. Hurst makes a majority of his sales through TikTok livestreams every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, when he greets loyal customers, welcomes newcomers and talks about the plants available in his shop. He joined TikTok Shop in April before its formal launch, and he's sold more than 30,000 plants since -- more than the number he sold in the three years before joining the platform. ""I try to turn it into kind of like a show, a little bit like QVC,"" Hurst said of his livestreams. ""Literally within the first five minutes, we already are at like 10 or 15 orders. It's incredible."" Although he already had viral plant videos on the app before joining TikTok Shop, it ""didn't equal sales the way that it now can, with the link right there in the video,"" Hurst said. Live selling online first emerged in China several years ago and exploded during the pandemic. Two-thirds of Chinese consumers purchased a product via livestream within the previous year, according to a 2020 survey. In 2022, an estimated $500 billion in goods were sold via livestream in China, accounting for about 23% of all e-commerce sales in the country, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Two of China's top live-streamers were able to sell $3 billion worth of goods in one day in October 2021. Although the phenomenon hasn't quite reached that scale yet in the U.S., platforms like Amazon, EBay and Poshmark have all launched their own live shopping features. The U.S. live selling market was expected to reach $32 billion in sales this year. Whenever I scroll through TikTok these days, I stumble upon at least one livestream pitching me a product I didn't know I needed. Lately, it's been a fast-talking man extolling the virtues of an electric scrubber. As he demonstrated its efficacy on a shower door recently, I pondered whether I should be deep-cleaning my bathtub. ""Thank you for your new orders, thank you thank you,"" he said as he aggressively rang a bell. ""You are doing a fantastic job."" Next, a woman was holding up the OQQ bodysuits that have been viral on TikTok for a while. I had been thinking about buying them for months. She wore one herself, as did another model who slipped in and out of frame. ""Go ahead and snag them while they're hot for sure,"" she said. ""We are already selling out today."" I entered my height and weight into the chat to ask what size I should purchase. I was surprised to hear her address me by name. ""Jaimie, we're out of stock of the extra small, so I'd go with the small,"" she said. With her blessing, I tapped ""buy,"" selected my size, and checked out with Apple Pay. Thirty seconds later, my brain humming from the dopamine hit, I'm back to scrolling through my usual TikTok feed and looking for the video that will pique my interest next. -- Pitching the pitchers I did not make my first purchase on TikTok Shop without a fair bit of skepticism. Were all these products low-quality, drop-shipped items from overseas? Were they cheap knockoffs from unknown Chinese companies, like many listings on Amazon? Given some of the cut-rate prices, I couldn't help but draw comparisons to companies like Shein, Temu, AliExpress and Wish, where it's often a toss-up whether the item you just ordered will be of durable quality or complete junk. The biggest barrier to more widespread adoption of social e-commerce is consumer trust, said Laura Gurski, North America commerce lead at Accenture Song. This is especially true among people in older demographics who are used to buying from reliable retailers and brands. This is why sellers earnestly pitching their own products can do so to such great effect through TikTok videos. They're in part borrowing tactics you might see on shopping channels like QVC, where trained hosts create intimacy with the viewer by gushing over products like they're gossiping with a friend. But unlike perfectly polished QVC hosts in a studio, the TikTok entrepreneur is unfiltered and up close -- sometimes even awkwardly so -- right there on your phone screen. Father-son duo Michael and Daniel Jay of San Diego started their brand Lazy Butt Club as a revamp of Michael's old T-shirt designs from decades ago. They went from less than 100 orders a year to 3,000 in a few weeks after their first viral TikTok video in 2021. ""Ever since we switched to being more personal and showing you what we're doing and our story, it's been a lot easier to resonate with people,"" said Daniel, who runs the TikTok account. In one video, I watched Michael pull one of his hand-drawn rough drafts of a T-shirt design out of a box. In another, he screen printed ""Tyrannosaurus Wrecks"" onto a crew neck, telling viewers that it would be the first one he's printed in 25 years. They joined TikTok Shop over the summer, generating a few thousand orders since then through both the platform and their website. It's opened up new avenues of business for them. ""One of the intimidating things about trying to work with influencers is having that business side already figured out, like how to pay them,"" Daniel said. ""I kind of didn't even know how to formulate a message and ask people, like how much should they get paid or whatever."" Sellers like the Jays help TikTok establish trust, so the platform has been aggressively courting them with a variety of incentives, such as covering the cost of free shipping for some buyers and offering frequent sales and coupons. ""When we first signed up, we were like, wait -- free shipping, like what do you mean free shipping? What is this sale?"" Daniel said. He was amazed to learn that a customer could purchase one of their shirts for as low as $8, while his company received the full price. With all the perks, several sellers said they don't even list items on Amazon because they consider the process too complicated or time-consuming, and the site generates too few sales. Chief Executive and founder Jay Nagy launched the Ocean Healed My Eczema in July directly onTikTok Shop. In just three months, he said, he's sold more than $1 million worth of eczema cream through the platform. It went viral with the help of creators like Beaupre, and through Nagy's videos about his own experience with eczema. ""TikTok Shop is so smart, it just puts it in front of the right people. It's really wild,"" Nagy said. ""They gave me the platform to really tell my story with my struggle with eczema."" When I first discovered Nagy's product, it was through a series of videos from creators that appeared during my daily TikTok binge-scrolling session. I have watched enough testimonials -- more than 10 -- to be convinced of its effectiveness. But I haven't bought the cream. After all, I don't have eczema. So I obviously don't need it. Right?

"March 15, 2024","BUSINESS; What would banning TikTok accomplish? Nada; Social media all share the same business model -- and the same risks, regardless of owner",61,"  In just the last few days, a couple of developments involving TikTok have arisen to illustrate the right and wrong way to think about the rapidly expanding social media platform. The first was a devastating expose that independent journalist Jonathan M. Katz posted there of a misleading story Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) told during her official GOP response to President Biden's State of the Union address. In his TikTok on March 8, the day after the speech, Katz expertly demolished Britt's claim to have interviewed an immigrant who told of having been sold out as a sex slave and Britt's attempt to tie the story to Biden's immigration policy -- never mind that the subject's travails took place 20 years ago, in Mexico, and had nothing to do with immigration policy. In doing do, Katz also exposed the laziness of our own political press corps, which had to scurry to follow his lead. This was social media at its best -- concise, visual and effective. The second occurrence was the House vote Wednesday to effectively ban TikTok. The measure, which passed by a lopsided, bipartisan vote of 352 to 65, requires TikTok's Beijing-based owner, ByteDance, to divest the platform's U.S. operations within six months or face a nationwide ban. The rationales put forth for the ban are varied and almost uniformly questionable. Its advocates cite the threat of Chinese government breaches of users' privacy, its potential use as a conduit of Chinese anti-democratic propaganda into the U.S., its purportedly deleterious effect on its youthful users -- one critic likened it to ""opium."" The campaign to ban TikTok deserves close scrutiny, covering such issues as who's really behind it and why this platform is taking more heat from lawmakers than all other social media platforms put together. The House's headlong plunge into TikTok-banning smacks of what the fictional panjandrums of ""Yes Minister"" labeled ""politicians' logic"": ""Something must be done; this is something; therefore, we must do it."" The thing that something must be done about is clipping the wings of the Beijing regime. Whether targeting TikTok will advance that purpose is doubtful in the extreme. As Sir Arnold Robinson and Sir Humphrey Appleby of that classic British political farce understood, this is all about theater. Let's start with the huge majority of the House vote, which brought 197 Republicans together with 155 Democrats in favor. The ""no"" vote, however, was also bipartisan, with 50 Democrats and 15 Republicans opposed. Capitol Hill observers chuckled over how the issue brought together the strangest of strange bedfellows, with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) voting on the same side (the ""no"" side) possibly for the first and last time from now to the end of recorded time. The ban's prospects in the Senate are uncertain, though President Biden has said he'd sign it if it passed. Donald Trump, who used to advocate a ban and even tried to implement a ban while he was president, more recently reversed himself, notably after a meeting with GOP megadonor Jeff Yass, who owns 15% of ByteDance. That stake is worth about $40 billion, based on the parent company's putative value of $268 billion as of year-end 2023. (Trump said the subject of TikTok didn't come up during their encounter.) Interestingly, a figure who slithered out of the woodwork as a potential buyer of TikTok if ByteDance does divest is Steven T. Mnuchin, who was Trump's Treasury secretary. He posed less as a savior of TikTok's users from the sinister designs of Chinese overlords than an investor spotting the main chance on the horizon. More on him in a moment. First, let's turn to who's pulling the strings on a TikTok ban. One evident culprit is Meta, which owns the social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. Meta paid for an extensive publicity campaign aimed at eroding TikTok's reputation by playing up its supposed threats to the health and welfare of young users, the Washington Post reported in 2022. Meta's concern isn't hard to understand: TikTok has become more popular than any of its platforms. Social media marketing surveys indicate that the average monthly time spent on Facebook this year has been around 15.4 hours; on Instagram it's 16.5 hours and on WhatsApp it's 16.75 hours. On TikTok, it's 27.9 hours. Even worse from Meta's standpoint, TikTok's user base has been skewing younger than Instagram's, its most direct competitor, and much younger than Facebook, which has been trending toward older users. As for the suggestions that TikTok is somehow uniquely injurious to youthful users, represents a unique threat to users' privacy, or presents a national security issue, one can only think this is some sort of a gag. The worst serial violator of users' privacy is arguably Meta. The company drew a record $5-billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission in 2019, when it was known as Facebook. That fine arose from Facebook's violations of a settlement the company had reached with the government in 2012 over its previous privacy violations, as well as a habit of deceiving users into thinking their privacy was secure. The FTC isn't done with Meta yet; as recently as Tuesday, the agency obtained a ruling from a federal appeals court allowing it to continue investigating the company's privacy practices, including allegations that it deceives parents about policies designed to protect children from online contacts with potential abusers. Spreading anti-democratic propaganda? Facebook's connections with the data firm Cambridge Analytica, which facilitated the spread of political propaganda in the presidential election and Brexit vote in 2016, have been thoroughly documented. (That's not to excuse the Chinese regime's appetite for censorship, or its mistreatment of ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs.) Anyone inclined to wring their hands over TikTok's role in sullying public discourse and internet safety in this country must acknowledge the role of all the leading social media platforms -- not only Meta but X and YouTube. All have fallen down on the job of policing disinformation, racism, antisemitism and other forms of hate speech on their sites. X bathes in all this as examples of ""free speech,"" as the platform's owner, Elon Musk, brags. All have undertaken layoffs that eviscerated their ""trust and safety"" teams, allowing untrustworthy and dangerous content to inundate their users. That brings us to Mnuchin. He surfaced Thursday on CNBC and the financial press with an announcement that he was putting together an investment consortium to take TikTok off ByteDance's hands, if the divestment becomes mandated. ""It's a great business and I'm going to put together a group to buy TikTok,"" he said. Would that make TikTok any safer for its users or democracy? Why would anyone think so? The last takeover of a social media company by a prominent individual was Musk's acquisition of Twitter, now renamed X. From the standpoint of users or anyone interested in a civil, reliable, safe public space, that deal has been disastrous. Under Musk's leadership, Twitter has become a sub-functional hellscape of filth that has evolved into a megaphone for its owner to pump conspiracy theories and hate speech out onto the internet. But the ban-TikTok campaign really isn't about any of that. As Jason Koebler of 404Media observes, a TikTok ban would ""have the effect of further entrenching and empowering gigantic, monopolistic American social media companies that have nearly all of the same problems that TikTok does."" He's right. At its heart, TikTok today is no different from the other platforms, and it won't become different no matter who owns it. All of them share the same business model, which is to deceive their users into thinking they're getting a valuable service for free, when in fact the users are simply raw material to be sold to advertisers and political manipulators, en masse. -- Hiltzik writes a blog on latimes.com.

"January 6, 2024",California-bound plane makes emergency landing after losing window midair,62,"  An Alaska Airlines flight bound for Southern California was forced to turn around and make an emergency landing after a hole opened in the side of the plane shortly after taking off Friday night. Flight 1282 left Portland International Airport in Oregon around 5 p.m. headed toward Ontario, with 171 passengers and six crew members on board, according to the airline.  While the plane was gaining altitude, a window and part of the plane's wall blew out, according to social media reports. Alaska Airlinesdescribed the event as ""an incident"" and said the plane turned around and safely landed back in Portland. ""The safety of our guests and employees is always our primary priority, so while this type of occurrence is rare, our flight crew was trained and prepared to safely manage the situation,"" Alaska Airlines said in a statement Friday night. ""We are investigating what happened and will share more information as it becomes available."" FlightAware, a public airplane tracker, listed the total flight length as 35 minutes.  A video posted to TikTok by a passenger on the flight showed a panel on the left side of plane missing, with insulation foam visible. Oxygen masks were deployed from the ceiling. The Federal Aviation Administration and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident. This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"March 6, 2024",California voters pick finalists for coveted California Senate seat,63,"  Californians on Tuesday cast ballots to whittle down the state's most competitive Senate race in a generation, selecting the two candidates who will face off in November to represent the Golden State in Washington.  Democratic Rep. Adam B. Schiff of Burbank, Rep. Katie Porter of Irvine and Rep. Barbara Lee of Oakland have been campaigning for more than a year to replace the late Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who had represented California in the Senate since 1992. The top Republican challenger, Steve Garvey, a former Dodgers All-Star, entered the race in October. The job, one of the most coveted in California politics, is rarely open. Feinstein was in the Senate for more than three decades, and Sen. Barbara Boxer served for nearly a quarter-century. A Senate seat can also be a launching pad for higher office, as was the case for Vice President Kamala Harris, President Nixon and California Gov. Pete Wilson.   For the first time in a generation, Californians may not be represented by a woman senator. Boxer and Feinstein were both elected in 1992, the so-called Year of the Woman in American politics. Whoever wins November's contest will serve alongside Sen. Alex Padilla, who was elected in 2022.  The statewide election brought Schiff, Porter and Lee - all popular Democrats who work together in Congress - onto a collision course for the first time, forcing California voters to parse their granular differences on the liberal spectrum. The candidates tried to emphasize their unique flavors of progressive politics. Schiff focused on his decades of experience in Washington, including his high-profile work as a House manager for President Trump's first impeachment trial. Porter struck a populist tone, promising to stand up to corporate influence in Washington. Lee leaned on her longtime progressive, antiwar credentials. And Garvey painted himself as an antidote to California's failed liberal leadership. The dynamics of the race were also shaped by California's unusual ""jungle primary"" system, in which the top two vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of party.  In an effort to box Porter out, Schiff and his allies staged what amounted to a free advertising campaign for Garvey, running political ads across the state calling the former Dodgers and Padres first baseman ""too conservative for California,"" and framing the election as a two-man race.  Garvey, who launched his campaign months after the Democratic front-runners, has barely been seen in public and did not hold any campaign events in the days leading up to the election. He has seen his support surge in recent weeks, coinciding with Schiff's flurry   of advertising, as he consolidated support from Republicans, who make up about one-fourth of California's registered voters.  In a state where Democrats have a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage, Schiff's odds would be most favorable if he faced a Republican in November. He would be an overwhelming favorite, t opening with a 53% to 38% lead over Garvey in a two-way matchup, according to a poll released last week by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by The Times. A race between Schiff and Porter, two Democrats, could prove more bruising and expensive, exposing fault lines between progressives and more moderate Democrats on controversial issues, including the country's military support for Israel in the war against Hamas. Negotiations over a potential government shutdown kept Lee, Porter and Schiff in Washington until the final few days of the election. They all crisscrossed the state in the waning hours of the campaign, making their final case to voters. Schiff rented a private plane, stopping in seven cities in two days, including San Diego, Sacramento, San Francisco and Salinas. He trotted out support from high-profile Democrats, including House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi and Robert Rivas, the new speaker of the California Assembly. ""Why do you think about 80% of our colleagues from California have endorsed Adam Schiff for Senate?"" Pelosi told the crowd at a Sunday evening event in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco. ""Because they know that he knows the Congress, and he knows California."" Not everyone gave Schiff a warm embrace, however. Schiff, who is Jewish, has not called for a permanent cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, saying he did not see ""how there could be a lasting peace as long as a terrorist organization is governing Gaza and threatening to attack them over and over and over again."" Half a dozen protesters interrupted Schiff's first stop of the weekend at a union hall for plumbers and steamfitters in Orange County, shouting: ""Shame on you, Adam!"" and ""Children are starving in Gaza!""  Porter voted with her 18-year-old son in Irvine on Saturday and swung through San Francisco on Sunday. A crowd at Manny's, a local community space and cafe in the Mission District, cheered as Porter told them that she had not taken money from corporate political action committees and that the election is ""a chance for us to define California as the cutting edge of democracy."" San Francisco resident Jared Barnes, 36, said he was backing Porter because he relates to her and her no-nonsense style. ""She's not a politician, and that's what I love about her - that authenticity,"" Barnes said. ""I like helping the underdog who is going up against the political elite."" Lee focused on voter-rich Southern California in the final days of the campaign, rallying supporters in the Inland Empire, San Diego, Orange County and Los Angeles. On the second floor of an Irvine bowling alley, she referenced her support for a cease-fire in Gaza, and told the crowd: ""When people ask what the differences are between myself and my opponents, I just have to say, there are more differences than similarities."" Alan Vargas, 22, of Corona has been sharing enthusiastic videos about Lee with his nearly 50,000 TikTok followers. Vargas wasn't yet born when Lee cast her famous, lone vote against the authorization of military force in Afghanistan in 2001, but said it was a pivotal reason why he supported her Senate run. ""She seems to be the only voice out there that's just taking a stand and being bold and brazen about what she believes in, like young people do,"" said Vargas, who said Lee's progressivism and antiwar politics are uniquely aligned with his values as a member of Generation Z. Laguna Beach resident Katie Loss, 69, was initially excited that, after a redrawing of California's electoral maps, Porter would be representing her city in Congress. Loss liked Porter's hard-charging style, and had contributed more than $1,000 to her House campaigns in 2020 and 2022. But Loss was dismayed when, three days after being sworn in, Porter said she would run for Senate. The timing of Porter's announcement made Loss feel that ""as a new constituent, our district was not her priority,"" she said. Instead, Loss is supporting Schiff, who she said she has long admired for his intelligence, his more than 20 years of experience in Washington and his willingness to stand up to Trump. And, she said, his polite, unflappable demeanor is ""badly needed in the Senate."" Though no longer in the Oval Office, Trump has become a major talking point in the campaign: Garvey, who voted for the former president twice, has not said whether he will vote for him again, and the Democrats have used the former president's name to burnish their liberal bona fides. Lee said she was one of the earliest supporters of impeachment, as well as the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit against Trump over his role in the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection. Porter talked about impeachment too, as well as her forceful interrogations of Trump appointees on the House Financial Services Committee. Still, Schiff - through his role as a House impeachment manager and regular appearances on cable news - was the most visible and forceful foil to Trump, who regularly called him out at rallies and insulted him on social media. That high-profile role helped Schiff raise millions in campaign funds. His campaign reported spending more than $22 million on advertising in about six weeks. Though a prodigious fundraiser herself, Porter's numbers lagged behind Schiff, who coasted to reelection to a 12th term in the House in 2022 and left millions untouched in his campaign account. Those funds provided a multimillion-dollar cushion to kick-start his Senate campaign. Lee struggled to raise enough money to mount a statewide advertising campaign, which costs millions of dollars. Both she and Schiff had pledged not to accept campaign contributions from corporate political action committees, a practice that Porter has followed since she first ran for office in 2018. Porter repeatedly criticized Schiff for previously accepting campaign funds from political action committees funded by corporations - including oil, pharmaceutical and financial firms - seeking to influence federal policy in Washington. She told him at a recent debate: ""I didn't realize how much dirty money you've took until I was running against you."" Schiff argued that Porter had accepted contributions from people who work in the oil industry, on Wall Street and for pharmaceutical companies - and that she had accepted contributions from Schiff in the past without complaint. A Times analysis of federal campaign data showed that Schiff's two fundraising committees contributed $54,675 to Porter while she was running for the House. The problem with the ""purity tests"" like the ones Porter has laid out, Schiff said at a recent debate, is that ""invariably, the people who establish them don't meet them."" The race was also shaped by more than $21 million in spending by outside groups, including an independent expenditure committee called Fairshake that spent more than $10 million to oppose Porter's candidacy. The group, funded by cryptocurrency investors, aired ads statewide (and hired a plane to circle the Hollywood Hills, towing a banner) that painted Porter as a hypocrite and an actor.

"March 22, 2024",Candace Owens Out at 'The Daily Wire' After Fighting With Co-Founder Over Israel-Hamas War,64,"  Conservative firebrand Candace Owens has left the news outlet The Daily Wire after a war of words with the founder of the news brand, fellow far-right figure Ben Shapiro, which began shortly after the outset of the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas. Owens joined the partisan conservative news website, which gained traction during former President Donald Trump's time in the White House,in 2020and hosted a weekday commentary show for the brand, known for repackaging other news outlets' reporting with a right-wing spin. The 34-year-old confirmed the news on Friday on X, the platform where most of the drama between the two conservative media figures played out.  ""The rumors are true - I am finally free. If you would like to support my work, you can head to http://CandaceOwens.com where you will be directed to my locals page,"" Owens tweeted, then solicited for funds on another personal website. ""There will be many announcements in the weeks to come."" The rumors are true- I am finally free.

The Daily Wire CEO Jeremy Boreing tweeted out the news about her employment to his followers 41 minutes beforehand, writing, ""Daily Wire and Candace Owens have ended their relationship."" Shapiro has not yet commented on Owens' departure. Daily Wire and Candace Owens have ended their relationship. - Jeremy Boreing (@JeremyDBoreing) March 22, 2024 The tension between the two stars of the conservative far-right began to play out online in mid-November, when Shapiro called out the ""faux sophistication"" Owens showed about the Israel-Hamas conflict; he then called her ""disreputable"" and ""ridiculous."" She has been ramping up her criticism of the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, where the Health Ministry in the Hamas-run region says the death toll is at around 32,000 since the war began. Owens, the former communications director for conservative PAC Turning Point USA, who is never one to back down from a fight, replied with Matthew 5:11, a verse from the Bible, and added, ""No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."" Shapiro replied to the host, ""Candace, if you feel that taking money from The Daily Wire somehow comes between you and God, by all means quit."" Candace, if you feel that taking money from The Daily Wire somehow comes between you and God, by all means quit. https://t.co/qachKhAuHo - Ben Shapiro (@benshapiro) November 15, 2023 The Anti-Defamation League, the New York-based international Jewish NGO, decided to weigh on Owens on Thursday by bringing up Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes, whom the advocacy group had tied to Owens earlier this week. On Thursday, the ADL had tweeted, ""White supremacist & Holocaust denier Nick Fuentes is praising Candace Owens' vitriolic antisemitism. It's hardly surprising, but it does set off alarm bells: When bigoted people come together to push an antisemitic agenda, it adds fuel to the fire of hate."" Owens replied to the ADL, writing on X that while she does not know Fuentes, she's ""grateful they have turned their smear merchant guns on me,"" and that since ""the world already knows my heart. Their attacks will have the opposite desired effect. Awaken world. Thank you, @adl.""  Owens, who defended Kanye West's antisemitic rant as he lost his partnerships including this lucrative deal with Adidas over the controversy, and appeared with the rapper it a Paris fashion show wearing a ""White Lives Matter"" T-shirt, has called Israel's campaign in Gaza ""genocide"" and has suggested ""Jews are going to be blamed"" if TikTok is banned. Owens is the author of the Blackout: How Black America Can Make Its Second Escape From the Democrat Plantation and in 2018, founded the social media campaign Blexit.

"March 8, 2024","Cat Janice, singer who died of cancer, told her family to 'keep the music going'",65,"  Over the years, many of Cat Janice's songs came to her in the car. But the last song she released before she died was a joint effort with her favorite passenger: her 7-year-old son Loren. Last spring, the two spontaneously began singing the refrain, ""Dance until you love me,"" as Janice drove, scrambling to record the moment in a voice note. A little less than a year later, Janice's disco hit, ""Dance You Outta My Head,"" reached the Billboard charts just as she entered hospice care. ""She had a bunch of music she could have released,"" her brother Will Ipsan, who makes his own music under the moniker Cubby, said. ""But she really wanted to leave everybody with something more on the positive side.""  After initially undergoing treatment for a rare sarcoma in 2022, Janice learned that her cancer had returned to her lungs last May. She documented the following months of grief, prayer, and patchy hair loss on TikTok before she died in her childhood home on Feb. 28.  Leading up to the release of ""Dance You Outta My Head"" on Jan. 19, the day before her 31st birthday, Janice announced that she'd signed her music rights over to Loren. As her last wish, she asked her followers to stream it for him. ""I wish I could say these words to you but lung cancer has stolen my voice. So all I ask is one favor of pre saving my final song in my bio,"" Janice wrote. ""I want my last song to bring joy and fun! It's all I've ever wanted through my battle with cancer."" In response, thousands posted videos of themselves dancing to the track - some while receiving their own cancer treatment. The song has now been used in more than 2 million TikTok videos.  Austin Bello, Janice's longtime producer, said he didn't expect the song to gain traction like it did. ""But I'm nothing but happy that her story got to be told,"" he said. ""I feel like it deserves that."" It was Janice's lyricism and rich vocal delivery that got Bello's attention, he said, but he grew to marvel at her artistry. ""The art that she was creating was something that was coming out of her organically and naturally,"" Bello said, chuckling as if amused by her effortlessness. ""It's just this beautiful thing where you don't have to dig and search for something creative. It was just there."" When it came to production, Janice knew what she wanted, exactly how it sounded in her head. ""My job was to try to hop into her brain and see what she was saying,"" Bello said.  It's a task Ipsan faces too, as he decides what to do with his sister's unreleased catalog. They had been mulling posthumous releases, he said, but Janice's health declined more quickly than they expected. One song, though, she was very clear about. ""It's a lullaby that she wrote for Loren,"" Ipsan said, ""just for him to be able to listen to on the airwaves, whenever he's on his way to sleep, or whenever he wants to."" ""There's no big strategy,"" he added. ""I just scheduled it for release and that'll be it."" Ipsan didn't disclose a release date, but he said the song will be on either Spotify or SoundCloud soon. He also said he will be posting ""bite-sized"" content to memorialize Janice on her Instagram while he plans a formal memorial service at her childhood church.  As for the rest, Ipsan is trying his best to do as Janice asked him: ""Just keep the music going."" ""Part of that charge for me as her brother is making sure that her son, that same spark for music carries over to him,"" Ipsan said. Janice's husband, Kyle Higginbotham - also a musician - just gave Loren a bass, so he seems to be on the right track. Like Janice was, Loren is easily excited, loves the outdoors, and always opts for a book over a video game. ""He's not an iPad kid by any means,"" Ipsan said. ""It's such a blessing that we have him, because he's so much like her."" On the day Janice passed, Ipsan said he and his siblings listened to her songs, comforted by the sound of her voice. ""My sister Meredith, she said, 'I'm so thankful that we have this music.'"" This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"February 23, 2024",Celeb Esthetician Shani Darden Explains How Exactly Gen Alpha Should Be Caring for Their Skin,66,"  As you've probably heard (or experienced firsthand), Gen Alpha loves skincare. Not that it's shocking for teens and tweens to be interested in makeup and skin products, but their tastes are definitely getting more expensive. And it's not just lip gloss or mascara anymore; we're talking Drunk Elephant and Charlotte Tilbury products on holiday wishlists and multi-step skincare routines every morning and night. The question is, are all these products (and those high price tags) really necessary when we're talking about 7- to 15-year-old kids? Dermatologist-trained esthetician Shani Darden of Shani Darden Facial Studio,who's worked with stars like Jessica Alba and Shay Mitchell, doesn't think so. ""Overall, I think it's harmful,"" she says of the Gen Alpha skincare craze on social media platforms like TikTok. ""Social media can expose teenagers and young kids to products that might not be right for their skin type."" That means that kids (and their parents) might be spending big on creams and face washes that don't even work well for their skin. ""It's so important to do the research on the brands and products they're interested in,"" Darden tells SheKnows. So what products should teens and tweens be using now, and what should you, as a parent, be investing in? As a mom of two daughters in their teens and tweens, Darden has a few simple rules to guide your next skincare purchases.. Your teen only needs three skincare products. Yes really - just three! ""A gentle cleanser, moisturizer, and sunscreen is sufficient,"" Darden says. ""I recommend keeping it simple."" Less truly is more in this case, as Darden notes that using too many products, especially on young skin, can do more harm than good. ""It can compromise their skin barrier and cause irritation,"" she explains. Be careful with active ingredients. Also known as actives, these ingredients are the ones that target specific skincare concerns, like acne, dry skin, or hyperpigmentation. (Hyaluronic acid, retinol, and vitamins A, C and E are among the common actives you've probably heard of.) For teens and tweens specifically, Darden says there's no need for actives ""unless they truly need it for acne."" Consult with a dermatologist or esthetician (see below) and avoid layering different products, Darden adds. ""It can still be a very simple routine."" Sunscreen is a must. Sunscreen is the one product we all should be using daily, no matter how old or young. ""The sun is so harmful to your skin and not only can it speed up aging in the long term, but it can also lead to skin cancer,"" Darden says. ""Both of my kids know to reach for their sunscreen every single day without me telling them to."" Consult with the experts. If your teen or tween wants to revamp their skincare routine, it's a good idea to talk to a dermatologist or esthetician first. They can ""recommend a routine that will work with [your child's] skin,"" Darden explains, and address any specific needs your child has, like acne or dryness. The best routine all depends on their skin type, she says. While your social media-savvy teen might want to slather on all the trendiest products, it's a good idea to listen to the experts on this one. ""A great skincare routine doesn't need to be complicated for young kids,"" Darden emphasizes. ""It can be as simple as washing your face in the morning and at night, wearing sunscreen everyday, and finding a great moisturizer for your skin type!""

"February 29, 2024",CITY & STATE; Gunman gets life in prison in theater killings; A TikTok star and a college student were fatally shot while on a date in Corona.,68,"  A man, who shot and killed a TikTok star and an 18-year-old college student at a Corona movie theater three years ago, was sentenced Monday to life in prison without possibility of parole. Joseph Jimenez Jr., 23, was sentenced in a Riverside courtroom. He was convicted during a December trial of two counts of first-degree murder, as well as a sentencing enhancement of personal use of a firearm causing death. On July 26, 2021, Jimenez shot 19-year-old TikTok star Anthony Barajas and college sophomore Rylee Goodrich, both of Corona, during a showing of the film ""The Forever Purge"" at the Regal Edwards Corona Crossings theater, according to authorities. Six people were in the audience for the 9:35 p.m. showing; Barajas and Goodrich were on their first date. In what authorities described as an ""unprovoked attack,"" Jimenez went to his car and got a bag containing a gun. He sneaked up behind the victims as the credits rolled and opened fire. Investigators said there was no indication Jimenez knew the victims or had any interaction with them before the shooting. Barajas was shot ""execution-style"" and Goodrich was also shot point-blank in the head, authorities said. Goodrich died at the scene, and Barajas died days later at a hospital after being taken off life support. Jimenez was arrested the day after the shooting after his friends told police he left the theater halfway through the movie and returned with a bag holding a ""strap,"" according to a search warrant. Investigators found a gun that matched the weapon used in the shooting, as well as additional evidence at Jimenez's house. Jimenez initially pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and said during his insanity trial that he was not taking his schizophrenia medication the day of the killings and heard voices in his head from ""Abigail"" and another person saying that the victims were dangerous. In a jailhouse interview with the Riverside Press-Enterprise, Jimenez said that he had been recently diagnosed with schizophrenia but that he had stopped taking his medication because he ran out of pills. Jimenez told the newspaper that the only way he could save himself from the victims was to shoot them. Jimenez was ruled sane by Superior Court Judge Timothy J. Hollenhorst in December. During the trial, Hollenhorst said his decision to find Jimenez sane was influenced by the fact that he stole Goodrich's wallet after the shooting and had a ""normal interaction"" with a female concession worker before the movie, in which he asked her for her phone number. Hollenhorst also pointed out that Jimenez warned his friends about the shooting, ran out of an emergency exit door afterward and didn't immediately tell Corona police about the voices. ""There is no question that the defendant suffers from schizophrenia. ... It is also clear to this court that the defendant was not treating his mental health issues appropriately by not regularly taking his medication,"" Hollenhorst said at the time. Barajas was known on TikTok by the handle itsanthonymichael and had nearly a million followers on the social media platform. He had attended Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana. Goodrich was a sophomore at Grand Canyon University. Her family said she and Barajas went to the theater on a first date after Barajas had just returned from a trip to Hawaii.

"March 17, 2024","CITY & STATE; Tesla Cybertruck, illegally driving on beach, gets stuck; Driver is fined $280 after incident at a Monterey County state park.",69,"  Tesla describes its Cybertruck as a durable and rugged vehicle that can go anywhere, but one Nevada man learned last week that's not always the case after his truck became stuck on a state beach in Monterey County. The incident occurred on Marc 4 at Marina State Beach when the owner of the Cybertruck drove over a curb and sidewalk and past a posted sign stating ""no vehicles on beach or dunes,"" according to Douglas Johnson, information officer with California State Parks. ""The Cybertruck soon got stuck,"" he said. ""With assistance from the Marina Fire Department the vehicle was able to get out by releasing air from the tires"" to improve traction. KSBW Action News 8 posted a video on its TikTok account. The video was taken by a woman at the beach and shows a state park officer talking to three men near the Cybertruck. In the video the woman and others laugh as the men push the truck out of the beach. Johnson said the driver was fined $280. The incident happened just a day after a Tesla Cybertruck crashed into the front sign of the Beverly Hills Hotel on Sunday night, prompting social media responses from the hotel and Tesla founder Elon Musk. A user of X, formerly Twitter, had joked in a post that the hotel valet had crashed his friend's Cybertruck. Musk responded to the post: ""Cyberbeast is faster than a Porsche 911, but looks like a truck, so perhaps the valet wasn't expecting so much acceleration."" The posts prompted the hotel to clarify that the hotel's valet was not involved in the incident.

"December 2, 2023","CITY & STATE; Video shows police punching, kneeing a suspect in the face; A San Bernardino officer is under investigation after witness' TikTok post.",70,"  A TikTok video showing an arrest by San Bernardino police in which a man is pinned to the ground and pummeled with fists and a knee to the face has led to an internal investigation. Cellphone video from a witness captured the incident, and an officer involved has been placed on modified assignment while the investigation is underway. The video shows two officers arresting a man. One officer is seen pinning him while another punches and knees the man in the head multiple times. The officers appear to instruct the man to put his hands behind his back and stop resisting. The man seems to cry out in pain. A third officer arrives on the scene as the man is being arrested. Edward Obayashi is a lawyer and former Plumas County sheriff's deputy who advises departments throughout California about use-of-force incidents. Although he described the incident as ""ugly,"" he told The Times there was nothing in the footage that led him ""to believe that this force was unreasonable."" ""There's no such thing as a pretty use-of-force video,"" he said. ""It just doesn't exist. When you see it, it's graphic, it's ugly. He was able to get up on his feet, and they handcuffed him without incident."" Obayashi cautioned that it was best to wait for the conclusion of an investigation before making a judgment about the arrest. The San Bernardino Police Department is not new to allegations of officers using excessive force. The department is facing a $100-million lawsuit, filed last year, in the fatal shooting of Rob Adams, a 23-year-old Black man. An independent autopsy from 2022 suggested Adams, who police say was armed, was shot multiple times from behind. The incident recorded in the TikTok video occurred Monday after the high-speed police chase of a suspected stolen vehicle in a residential neighborhood near West 50th Street and Electric Avenue North in San Bernardino. During the chase, the suspect lost control of the car and crashed into a telephone pole. San Bernardino Police Lt. Jennifer Kohrell declined to identify the officers involved in the chase and arrest. Police Chief Darren Goodman issued a statement saying, ""We will take the necessary steps to correct any officer's actions that are inconsistent with protecting our community, providing quality service, and fostering trust.""

"January 18, 2024","COLUMN ONE; Rich Mexicans use exotic pets to flaunt status, at a steep cost",71,"  Emilia is a 2-year-old spider monkey who wears jeans, crop tops and Armani perfume. A popular TikTok account documents her busy life: trips to the spa, gym and church, as well as elaborate birthday parties for other pet monkeys, where she might cavort with friends in an inflatable bounce house and smash her face into a carrot cake. It is illegal in Mexico to own spider monkeys, which are critically endangered and trafficked from jungles in the country's south. That hasn't stopped people in the northern city of Culiacan, home to one of the world's most powerful drug cartels and known for ostentatious displays of wealth. ""So many people here have them,"" said Zulma Ayala, a 34-year-old florist who was gifted Emilia two years ago. ""It's fashionable. It says: 'I have the money to have a monkey.' "" Primates aren't the only exotic animals popular here. At private homes and ranches in Culiacan and across the rest of rugged Sinaloa state, it is not uncommon for people to keep lions, tigers and, yes, even bears. The practice began decades ago as local narcos sought to emulate Colombian drug lords like Pablo Escobar, who famously stocked private zoos with giraffes, elephants and hippos. Now, wealthy people of all stripes in Mexico own exotic animals. They walk tigers on leashes down city streets and parade them in the backs of luxury cars. Socialites have formed private ""monkey clubs,"" gathering for extravagant Christmas posadas and pool parties. The internet fuels the phenomenon, with influencers showing off their exotic pets and social media making it easier than ever to acquire the animals. A quick search of Facebook turns up local vendors selling lion cubs, lemurs and rare white tigers. One of the few veterinarians in northern Mexico trained to treat exotic animals is Roy Quintero, whose patients include Emilia the spider monkey. His phone rings often with calls from anxious pet owners. Once he was asked to treat a monkey that had accidentally consumed fentanyl. (He managed to save it.) Another time he helped an owner track down a tiger that had escaped into a canyon. Then there was the time Quintero found himself high in the sky in a propeller airplane alongside a sedated 300-pound tiger, which he was helping to transport. ""I was terrified he was going to wake up,"" Quintero said. Quintero, who makes a practice of never asking his clients what they do for work, said he has been threatened with death several times, including once when he was unable to save a monkey that died after consuming a toxin. His job is risky and -- he's the first to admit -- ethically murky. He fell in love with animals as a poor kid in nearby Sonora state, where he began tending goats at age 9. Decades spent working in zoos deepened his knowledge of how to heal uncommon animals, as well as his conviction that most people simply aren't equipped to care for creatures meant to thrive in the wild. ""It's really easy to acquire one,"" he said. ""It's much harder to feed them right, give them enough space and give them the care they need."" But when his phone buzzes and an owner asks for help, Quintero almost always gives in. A father of four, he has mouths to feed. And he can't stand the thought of an animal in need. ""I don't like it,"" he said. ""But if I don't treat them, who will?"" -- On a recent afternoon, Quintero threw a medical bag into the back of his Isuzu pickup and headed out of town. He had spent the morning at his Culiacan clinic checking up on several patients, including a 4-year-old spider monkey named Elisa who had been hit by a car after escaping from her owner's home. Quintero had performed a complicated reconstructive surgery on the monkey's hand, and she was slowly healing. Dressed in khaki pants and work boots, Quintero kept a wide-brimmed safari hat on the seat next to him -- part of his security strategy. The uneasy peace that held while Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman led the Sinaloa cartel shattered several years ago when he was sentenced to life in a U.S. prison. Since then, other leaders of the cartel have battled for supremacy while being hunted by the Mexican government. Quintero hopes that if he is stopped by the military or drug traffickers, donning the hat will broadcast his identity: a harmless veterinarian just trying to get to work. He passed a small Catholic chapel set against the scrubby landscape and an elaborate altar to Santa Muerte, a figure revered among drug traffickers here. He rolled through an army checkpoint, waving to fatigue-clad soldiers, and by a road sign riddled with bullet holes. Finally, he arrived at the ranch, tucked off a main highway, down a dirt road. More than 30 big cats paced inside cages, some of which were the size of a studio apartment. A bald eagle flapped around an enclosure. A wolf-dog hybrid scampered about. Cacophony filled the humid air: the mad squawking of parrots, the grunts of emus, the occasional roar of a lion. Agustin Felix, a 26-year-old in tight jeans, expensive sneakers and a trucker hat, greeted Quintero with a slap on the back. Felix is the son of a businessman who owns a transportation company and a cemetery. His father used to collect classic cars but several years ago started acquiring uncommon animals. Though owning spider monkeys is prohibited in Mexico, buying and selling many other exotic species is legal as long as they are not taken from the wild. That includes lions, tigers and jaguars. Owners must obtain approval from a government agency and show evidence that the animal was born in captivity. Laws stipulate that the animal must be safely confined and treated with respect, although a shortage of inspectors results in lax enforcement. Once his father began acquiring large felines, Felix said, friends started asking how they could get their own. ""Here, people see something new, and then everyone wants it."" As they toured the ranch, Quintero sought to put the animals at ease by imitating their sounds, emitting a low whistle to the jaguars and blowing air through his lips at the tigers. Felix handed his phone to a friend and posed alongside the animals for pictures for social media. After he and Quintero inspected a pair of former circus bears that had recently been donated to the ranch, Felix showed the vet his newest prize: a Bengal tiger cub born there a few months earlier. The cub had an unusually narrow face, which Quintero said was likely the result of inbreeding, a common occurrence given the lack of genetic diversity among big cats in captivity. The cub also looked malnourished. ""You have to supplement his diet,"" Quintero said, recommending omega-3s and taurine, an amino acid critical for tigers that is also a main ingredient in energy drinks. ""Will Red Bull work?"" Felix joked. His friend laughed heartily. Quintero struggled to crack a smile. Back on the road, Quintero said he was feeling down -- and ready for an after-work drink. ""I'm depressed all the time,"" he said. ""This is an animal that is under threat of extinction, and it's somebody's toy."" -- Wealthy rulers throughout history, from Carlos III of Spain to Moctezuma, the ruler of the Aztec Empire, have kept menageries. Today's narcos are likely to be influenced more by the zoos of Colombian traffickers or films like ""Scarface,"" the gangster flick whose protagonist, Tony Montana, famously kept a tiger as a pet. At a sprawling animal sanctuary on the outskirts of Culiacan on a recent afternoon, a regal tiger blinked in the sun. The animal had survived a gun fight, said Ernesto Zazueta, director of the Ostok Sanctuary, and had battle scars on its face and shoulder. ""They shot him two or three times,"" Zazueta said. Many of the hundreds of animals at this sprawling reserve were confiscated after police raids on the homes of traffickers. Others were abandoned because their owners couldn't care for them or feared that they would bring unwanted attention from authorities. Zazueta pointed to a puma huddled near the back of its cage. It had been dumped, left chained to a post in the center of a nearby town. Mexico is rife with stories about exotic narco pets. There was the recent U.S. federal indictment that accused the sons of El Chapo of feeding their enemies to tigers. (Their lawyers denied it.) Or the spider monkey found dead in a cartel shootout in Mexico state, dressed in a tiny bulletproof vest. A corrido singer quickly penned a ballad about the fallen primate. Just as other trappings of narcoculture have proliferated throughout Mexican society -- from norteno fashion to the new generation of drug ballads that top national charts -- so too has the ownership of exotic animals. ""For rich people, it gives them a sense of power,"" said Zazueta. ""The more powerful the animal, the more powerful it makes them feel."" His sanctuary is working to import from Colombia several descendants of Escobar's famous ""cocaine hippos,"" which were abandoned into the wild after his death in 1993 and have reproduced rapidly, posing environmental challenges. While Sinaloa's wealthy men gravitate toward tigers and lions, Zazueta said, their female counterparts tend to collect spider monkeys. Local influencers and their pampered primates dominate TikTok. The social media stars include a monkey named Kira Sophia, who appeared in a music video and whose TikTok boasts nearly 25,000 followers. A clip of her lavish 1st birthday party, featuring a live band and a procession of horses, was viewed more than 2 million times. Many people here treat their monkeys like children, swaddling them in cribs at night and dressing them in diapers -- cutting a hole for their long tails. Some monkeys wear name-brand clothing and sport gold chains around their thin, hairy necks. But behind the scenes, having a monkey is a lot of work. Just ask Emilia's owner. Ayala has retrofitted her elegant home with monkey bars and ropes to keep Emilia from swinging from the television or ceiling fans. She isn't quite sure how to deal with Emilia's occasional outbursts of aggression -- recently the monkey took a bite out of her teenage son's chest -- and checks in frequently with Quintero, the vet, to make sure she's feeding her pet the right mix of fruits, minerals and protein. Her son sometimes jokes that Ayala spends more time caring for Emilia than for him. ""And he's right,"" she said. Ayala changes Emilia's diapers eight times a day. She gives the monkey long baths -- Emilia loves warm water -- followed by a blow dry and a spritz of Armani perfume. She takes Emilia to the store and to meetings, graciously stopping to let strangers pose with her for photographs. Sometimes it's so much work that Ayala doesn't have time for a shower. Sometimes, after a particularly hard day, she finds herself weeping. ""She's like a child, but three times the work,"" Ayala said on a recent warm evening as Emilia scampered around, playing with a helium balloon and an empty plastic bottle. Cuddling Emilia at night makes everything worth it, Ayala said. But sometimes it makes her sad knowing that Emilia will never grow up. ""I call her my little girl,"" said Ayala. ""But she's never going to stop being a monkey."" Graphic    PHOTO: VETERINARIAN Roy Quintero, who spent decades working in zoos, cares for an injured deer in Culiacan.

"March 14, 2024",Column: What would banning TikTok accomplish? Answer: Virtually nothing,72,"  In just the last few days, a couple of developments involving TikTok have arisen to illustrate the right and wrong way to think about the rapidly expanding social media platform. The first was a devastating exposé that independent journalist Jonathan M. Katz posted there of a misleading story Sen. Katie Britt (R-Ala.) told during her official GOP response to President Biden's State of the Union address.  In his Tiktok on March 8, the day after the speech, Katz expertly demolished Britt's claim to have interviewed an immigrant who told of having been sold out as a sex slave and Britt's attempt to tie the story to Biden's immigration policy - never mind that the subject's travails took place 20 years ago, in Mexico, and had nothing to do with immigration policy.  In doing do, Katz also exposed the laziness of our own political press corps, which had to scurry to follow his lead. This was social media at their best - concise, visual and effective. The second occurrence was the House vote Wednesday to effectively ban TikTok. The measure, which passed by a lopsided, bipartisan vote of 352-65, requires TikTok's Beijing-based owner, ByteDance, to divest the platform's U.S. operations within six months or face a nationwide ban. The rationales put forth for the ban are varied and almost uniformly questionable. Its advocates cite the threat of Chinese government breaches of users' privacy, its potential use as a conduit of Chinese anti-democratic propaganda into the U.S., its purportedly deleterious effect on its youthful users - one critic likened it to ""opium."" The campaign to ban TikTok deserves close scrutiny, covering such issues as who's really behind it and why this platform is taking more heat from lawmakers than all other social media platforms put together. The House's headlong plunge into TikTok-banning smacks of what the fictional panjandrums of ""Yes Minister"" labeled ""politicians' logic"": ""Something must be done; this is something; therefore, we must do it."" The thing that something must be done about is clipping the wings of the Beijing regime.  Whether targeting TikTok will advance that purpose is doubtful in the extreme. As Sir Arnold Robinson and Sir Humphrey Appleby of that classic British political farce understood, this is all about theater. Let's start with the huge majority of the House vote, which brought 197 Republicans together with 155 Democrats in favor. The ""no"" vote, however, was also bipartisan, with 50 Democrats and 15 Republicans opposed.  Capitol Hill observers chuckled over how the issue brought together the strangest of strange bedfellows, with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) voting on the same side (the ""no"" side) possibly for the first and last time from now to the end of recorded time. The ban's prospects in the Senate are uncertain, though President Biden has said he'd sign it if it passed.  Donald Trump, who used to advocate a ban and even tried to implement a ban while he was president, more recently reversed himself, notably after a meeting with GOP megadonor Jeff Yass, who owns 15% of ByteDance. That stake is worth about $40 billion, based on the parent company's putative value of $268 billion as of year-end 2023. (Trump said the subject of TikTok didn't come up during their encounter.) Interestingly, a figure who slithered out of the woodwork as a potential buyer of TikTok if ByteDance does divest is Steven T. Mnuchin, who was Trump's Treasury secretary. He posed less as a savior of TikTok's users from the sinister designs of Chinese overlords than an investor spotting the main chance on the horizon. More on him in a moment.  First, let's turn to who's pulling the strings on a TikTok ban. One evident culprit is Meta, which owns the social media platforms Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.  Meta paid for an extensive publicity campaign aimed at eroding TikTok's public reputation by playing up its supposed threats to the health and welfare of young users, the Washington Post reported in 2022. Meta's concern isn't hard to understand: TikTok has become more popular than any of its platforms. Social media marketing surveys indicate that the average monthly time spent on Facebook this year has been around 15.4 hours; on Instagram it's 16.5 hours and on WhatsApp it's 16.75 hours. On TikTok, it's 27.9 hours. Even worse from Meta's standpoint, TikTok's user base has been skewing younger than Instagram's, its most direct competitor, and much younger than Facebook, which has been trending toward older users. As for the suggestions that TikTok is somehow uniquely injurious to youthful users, represents a unique threat to users' privacy, or presents a national security issue, one can only think this is some sort of a gag. The worst serial violator of users' privacy is arguably Meta. The company drew a record $5-billion fine from the Federal Trade Commission in 2019, when it was known as Facebook. That fine arose from Facebook's violations of a settlement the company had reached with the government in 2012 over its previous privacy violations, as well as a habit of deceiving users into thinking their privacy was secure.  The FTC isn't done with Meta yet; as recently as Tuesday, the agency obtained a ruling from a federal appeals court allowing it to continue investigating the company's privacy practices, including allegations that it deceives parents about policies designed to protect children from online contacts with potential abusers. Spreading anti-democratic propaganda? Facebook's connections with the data firm Cambridge Analytica, which facilitated the spread of political propaganda in the presidential election and Brexit vote in 2016, have been thoroughly documented. (That's not to excuse the Chinese regime's appetite for censorship, or its mistreatment of ethnic minorities such as the Uyghurs.) Anyone inclined to wring their hands over TikTok's role in sullying public discourse and internet safety in this country must acknowledge the role of all the leading social media platforms - not only Meta but X and YouTube.  All have fallen down on the job of policing disinformation, racism, antisemitism and other forms of hate speech on their sites. X bathes in all this as examples of ""free speech,"" as the platform's owner, Elon Musk, brags. All have undertaken layoffs that eviscerated their ""trust and safety"" teams, allowing untrustworthy and dangerous content to inundate their users. That brings us to Mnuchin. He surfaced Thursday on CNBC and the financial press with an announcement that he was putting together an investment consortium to take TikTok off ByteDance's hands, if the divestment becomes mandated. ""It's a great business and I'm going to put together a group to buy TikTok,"" he said. Would that make TikTok any safer for its users or democracy? Why would anyone think so? The last takeover of a social media company by a prominent individual was Musk's acquisition of Twitter, now renamed X. From the standpoint of users or anyone interested in a civil, reliable, safe public space, that deal has been disastrous. Under Musk's leadership, Twitter has become a sub-functional hellscape of filth that has evolved into a megaphone for its owner to pump conspiracy theories and hate speech out onto the internet. But the ban-TikTok campaign really isn't about any of that. As Jason Koebler of 404Media observes, a TikTok ban would ""have the effect of further entrenching and empowering gigantic, monopolistic American social media companies that have nearly all of the same problems that TikTok does.""  He's right. At its heart, TikTok today is no different from the other platforms, and it won't become different no matter who owns it. All of them share the same business model, which is to deceive their users into thinking they're getting a valuable service for free, when in fact the users are simply raw material to be sold to advertisers and political manipulators, en masse.

"March 27, 2024","CONGA ROOM'S LAST DANCE; Latin music lovers have packed the club for over two decades. Just before it closes, its founders look back.",73,"  For one more night, the papaya bar still beckons at the Conga Room in downtown L.A. The yellow sculptural design from Cuban American artist Jorge Pardo -- meant to resemble the tropical fruit split open -- has served cocktails to Latin music lovers since this incarnation of the Conga Room opened at L.A. Live in 2008, a decade after the club debuted in Miracle Mile. The murals of angelic luchadors, from artist Sergio Arau, are still up for now, as are the ceiling panels meant to resemble a cascade of flowers. ""This thing is not evergreen,"" said co-founder Brad Gluckstein, looking over a wall of portraits and concert shots taken on the Conga Room's stage. ""But it's allowing a really exhilarating transition, as opposed to just longing for what was. Twenty-five years is a long run."" The Conga Room will go dark forever on Wednesday with what's expected to be a rowdy, teary send-off show. The closure marks the end of a chapter in local Latin music, one in which the Conga Room cultivated multiple generations of stars and brought titans of music history through its doors, from Celia Cruz to Bad Bunny, Los Van Van to J Balvin. The music that the Conga Room has championed since the '90s has never been more popular globally. Amid the success of Latin music on stadium tours, festival stages and streaming platforms, the venue's founders are making peace with what that has meant for their nightlife niche. They can reflect on the impact that the Conga Room had -- and why it's time to let it rest. ""All that's happening right now in front of us is probably, to a certain degree, because of us,"" Gluckstein said. ""I don't think LeBron's scoring record will ever be broken, and I have a hard time believing that in Los Angeles, you'll see a run with the same success that we had."" Gluckstein and his co-founder, ""NYPD Blue"" and ""L.A. Law"" actor Jimmy Smits, are sifting through decades of memories. In the green room, Gluckstein has a photo album in which his much-younger self poses with Jennifer Lopez and Willie Colon, the Boricua salsa music titan. Smits laughed as he recalled one overpacked night where he got roped into manning security detail at the height of his TV fame. Both reverently recalled Prince cornering them backstage before a gig to advocate for artists to get paid when DJs spun their records. ""It's been like losing a family member,"" Smits said. ""I came here from New York and was searching out any kind of tropical music. On any given night, you could come and see people wearing cowboy hats, or people dancing their asses off for reggaeton nights. Sheila E was involved from the beginning, and one of my fondest memories was Prince taking the stage here. The club was able to give voice to a kind of panorama of what Latino music can be."" When the Conga Room first opened in 1998, Latin music was in one of its waves of commercial success among wider audiences. Celebrities such as comedian Paul Rodriguez, singer Tito Nieves and record label owner Ralph Mercado signed on as investors to open the 400-capacity room, within walking distance of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Ricky Martin and Lopez (another co-investor) were ascendant pop stars, and rock en espanol acts such as Mana were winning acclaim. The Selena biopic brought fresh attention to the late Tejana star's music, and in 1999, Wim Wenders' documentary on the Cuban group Buena Vista Social Club renewed global interest in the Latin music of the Caribbean. On opening night in 1998, when Cuban singer Celia Cruz headlined, The Times noted that ""a very interesting paradox ... lies at the heart of the venue: A lot of money has been spent to re-create the smoky atmosphere of the kind of Cuban clubs that were originally geared toward the working class. Of course, bring somebody like Cruz on stage and the whole evening turns into a family affair."" ""We were doing things that nobody had ever done on the West Coast,"" Gluckstein said. ""We had a steady diet of Cuban music, Los Van Van and Pablo Milanes. We had gigantic salseros who would normally play to 10,000 people in Colombia or Venezuela. We were privileged to be able to feature them, and they were excited because of the sound quality and the way we treated artists."" The club became a favorite spot for politicians to mingle, and it hosted the Democratic National Convention kickoff party in 2000 with Bill Clinton and Al Gore attending. It hosted the Latin Grammys after the 9/11 attacks canceled plans at the Forum. When the club migrated to the freshly constructed L.A. Live after a two-year hiatus, what had been an intimate spot for music discovery turned into a gleaming showcase for Latin music at the heart of downtown's sports and music megaplex. ""Our first venue was a hole in the wall,"" said Gluckstein, fondly. ""Despite the trappings of L.A. Live, how clean and industrial this complex is, we dreamt big."" Oscar Hernandez, leader of the Spanish Harlem Orchestra, came on as music director. The venue also diversified from its salsa roots, giving the actor Jamie Foxx's R&B band a long-standing residency, and booking early gigs from Ed Sheeran and Avicii. As the wave of reggaeton and musica urbana began to crest, the Conga Room booked some of the first L.A. shows for Maluma, J Balvin and Bad Bunny. ""Bad Bunny canceled his tour's club dates the day after our venue,"" Gluckstein said. ""We were really advanced. You never saw him in a club again."" ""The music changes, that's the beauty,"" Smits said. ""Latinos like how the influence of the older styles of music gets mixed in. We've tried to preserve those tropical nights, but to give exposure to different genres of Latin music. When it started with reggaeton and how hip-hop influenced the whole way this music is perceived, we adapted."" Yet the club's prospects dimmed, like it did for so many others, when the pandemic hit. ""We were killing it before the pandemic. Our club nights were off the charts, and we were booking a lot of events,"" Gluckstein said. But they returned to find younger fans' nightlife habits had changed, right as acts like Bad Bunny were headlining Coachella and Mexican music acts like Peso Pluma and Fuerza Regida became megastars on TikTok. ""Artists are having a hard time making a living other than what they're getting paid to do concerts. So that ratchets up the price to make tours more viable,"" Gluckstein said. ""I think it's become talent-based and not club-centric. Kids aren't going to big dance halls as much. If they do see a Latin concert, they're going to the Forum."" Gluckstein said that after 25 years running nightclubs, he wanted to concentrate more on his youth charity, Conga Kids, which brings Latin music and dance classes to 50,000 local youth. But first he will memorialize one of the foundational venues in modern Latin music. At the Wednesday party, Gov. Gavin Newsom will appear in a sendoff video, and a who's-who of politicians including Sen. Alex Padilla, former Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and state education Superintendent Tony Thurmond will speak. Gilberto Santa Rosa, fondly known as ""El Caballero de la Salsa,"" will lead a 16-piece orchestra, and the night will wrap with a jam session led by Jerry Rivera (""El Bebe de la Salsa"") and Santana's singer, Andy Vargas. Latin music is at its most exciting zenith in U.S. since the late '90s, when the Conga Room debuted. Gluckstein and Smits said they'll part ways with the venue with no regrets. But who will take the papaya bar home? Gluckstein laughed and said maybe he would. ""Only if we have enough ground in our backyard and it can deal with rain,"" he said. ""It's a fickle city.""

"March 13, 2024",Congress is threatening to ban TikTok. Here's what you should know,74,"  The House of Representatives' lopsided vote Wednesday in favor of a bill banning TikTok in the U.S. unless it is freed from Chinese control suggests the wildly popular short-video app could soon join Netscape and Myspace in the dustbin of history. But the situation is far more complicated than that.  Policymakers agree that TikTok poses unique privacy and security threats because of the Chinese government's influence over its owner, Beijing-based ByteDance. But the app has a powerful, albeit newly converted, backer in former President Trump, meaning that Republicans who would ordinarily support any bill to lessen Chinese influence are torn on the TikTok proposal. Beyond that, TikTok captures the attention of an estimated 150 million Americans each month, roughly half of whom are active users, making it one of the most popular apps in the country - despite concerns about privacy, misinformation and harm to young users. The potential ban has drawn fiery objections from across the country, including from entrepreneurs, small businesses and marketers who say it would be a financial shock. Some opponents of a ban have called it a violation of the 1st Amendment. Others wondered why TikTok was being singled out as a threat, considering how many apps hoover up their users' personal data. And some argued that the bill would benefit only U.S. tech giants Meta, the owner of Facebook and Instagram, and Alphabet, the owner of YouTube. Here's a quick rundown of what's happening and why, and what it means for TikTok users. What does the bill seek from TikTok? The House-passed bill seeks to do the same thing Trump sought to do as president: take TikTok out of the hands of a Chinese company subject to Chinese law. The Trump administration went so far as to ban TikTok in the United States in 2020. That order was blocked by two federal courts, however, which held that the administration had overstepped its authority. ByteDance, an internet-focused, venture-capital-funded startup founded in China in 2012, owns 100% of TikTok. Although outside investors control 60% of ByteDance, according to Axios, the Chinese company retains operational control. The new bill, which sped through the House, would prohibit companies from distributing, maintaining or updating a ""foreign adversary controlled application,"" or providing internet hosting services for companies that do any of those things. It defines ""foreign adversary controlled application"" as ByteDance, TikTok and its successors, although it would give the president the power to name other social media and communications apps with 1 million or more users that are controlled by people residing in a ""foreign adversary country."" If passed by the Senate and signed into law, the measure would give ByteDance 180 days to end Chinese control, which would require it to limit Chinese investors to a 20% stake in the company. That would probably require ByteDance to spin off TikTok into an independent company with more limited Chinese investment. If ByteDance did not comply, the bill would require it to let users retrieve all their data, including all information about their preferences, views and uploads, in a format that could be transferred to another social media app. Who uses TikTok? According to Pew Research Center, 33% of U.S. adults said last year that they use TikTok. That's a lot of people, yet it pales in comparison with the number using other major social media platforms. According to Pew, 83% of U.S. adults said last year that they use YouTube and 47% said they use Instagram.  Young people are far more likely to use TikTok than their parents, but even they make heavier use of YouTube and Instagram. According to Pew, 62% of 18- to 29-year-olds say they use TikTok, as do 63% of 13- to 17-year-olds. ""To me, TikTok is modern-day television and so any kind of disturbance of it would really hurt people - not just creators - because people really enjoy it,"" said television personality Foodgod, formerly known as Jonathan Cheban.  Foodgod, who has 8.5 million followers for his food and lifestyle videos on TikTok, said he cycles through the social media apps on his phone every hour and enjoys the more casual vibe on TikTok. Banning it, he said, would be ""literally like going into someone's room and ripping their TV out of the wall, which I think is insane."" ""But honestly, I think TikTok is here to stay. There's too many people on it and too many people love it,"" he said. ""It feels like you're so much freer on TikTok to do what you want. It's not like Instagram - everything is so structured and you have to make it perfect."" Could the government really ban TikTok? Passing the Senate might be the smallest hurdle remaining for a TikTok ban.  ByteDance and other opponents of the bill are almost certain to challenge it in court on 1st Amendment grounds, just as they successfully challenged Montana's attempt to ban the app. Defenders of the bill say it doesn't impinge on free speech because it targets ByteDance's conduct, not the content on the app. But critics counter that the bill wouldn't protect Americans from having their data harvested by foreign interests. Telecom industry experts say that it's technically possible to ban TikTok, but there are issues. First, the bill wouldn't remove TikTok from the phones that already have it. It would, however, bar companies from providing TikTok updates, which could render the app unusable over time as phone operating systems change. Second, although the bill would force Google Play and Apple's App Store to stop distributing TikTok's app in the U.S., it wouldn't apply to non-U.S. sources of phone software, nor would it be easy to enforce on unofficial sites online. So the app and its updates would remain available to people willing and able to ""sideload"" them from such sources.  That's not hard on an Android phone, but on an Apple iPhone, it's trickier - at least for now. Apple has just started allowing a form of sideloading in Europe, in response to the European Digital Markets Act.  There's a trade-off to this approach, however, said Emma Llansó, former director of the Free Expression Project at the Center for Democracy and Technology. Without regular privacy and security updates, the app would become ""a great target for people looking to exploit out-of-date software,"" she said, adding, ""It creates this other kind of vulnerability that would be affecting millions of people, including a lot of young people."" If the government formally outlawed TikTok, network operators could conceivably block traffic between the company's servers and U.S. users. But the app's enormous user base may rush to find ways to circumvent any barriers, such as using virtual private networks to connect to TikTok through other countries, said Michael Calabrese, director of the Wireless Future Project at New America. ""Savvy Chinese can do it, so [it] should be so much easier here,"" Calabrese said. ""I wouldn't be surprised if this became a thing."" What would a ban mean for content creators and small businesses? An effective ban - which, again, is not a sure thing even if the bill becomes law - would mean at least three things for content creators. Established creators would be cut off from the loyal audience of followers they'd worked to build. New and established creators alike would lose access to a giant global marketplace of viewers. And creators of all stripes would have one fewer outlet for their work that offered unique tools and sensibilities. The same would be true for the estimated 7 million small businesses that use TikTok to boost sales, by the app's count. According to a survey last year by Capterra, a software consultant, small and medium-size businesses say their marketing efforts get far more engagement on TikTok than on other social media networks. According to the Capterra survey, businesses have found the social network to be particularly useful in capitalizing on trends, carving out a distinct niche for their brand and educating customers about their products and services.  Granted, there are other platforms for the short videos that make up the vast majority of TikTok content, including Instagram Reels and YouTube #Shorts. Like TikTok, they use secret and mystifying algorithms to decide which videos to show users; the lessons creators learned in TikTok about how to generate views and build an audience may not apply anywhere else. Anecdotes abound about people who quit their day jobs so they could build a business out of TikTok videos. The platform isn't just for dancers, lip-synchers and pranksters - it's also become a serious vehicle for ecommerce. The app launched TikTok Shop in September, quickly powering $7 million in sales a day. ""I'm kind of in denial to be honest,"" said Kelsey Martinez, 32, a TikTok creator who lives in Pasadena. ""It just never occurred to me that this could actually happen. If TikTok were to go away tomorrow, it would completely change my entire life."" Martinez joined the platform in 2022, mainly posting about her weight-loss journey. Last summer, after expanding her videos to include fashion, beauty and lifestyle content, her TikTok account took off, growing to more than 287,000 followers today. She gets a cut of the sales made from product links included in her videos, and has landed brand deals with skin-care companies Murad and Salt & Stone as well as Lizzo's shapewear brand, Yitty. ""I actually stepped away from my full-time position because I've been able to make a living and make multiple times my yearly salary through TikTok. And so, really, it's everything,"" said Martinez, who previously worked in human resources for a nonprofit.  ""This is what I do, this is my job. I would definitely take a hit if it were to go away,"" she said.  Many creators say they already cross-post their TikTok videos to Instagram and other platforms (and vice versa), although the results can differ dramatically and unpredictably. TikTok creators who aren't already putting their work on multiple platforms have a few months to do so before a federal ban could take effect.  Bear in mind that the sites have different approaches to monetizing videos and generating revenue for creators. And building an audience presents a different challenge on each platform; for example, Meta-owned Facebook and Instagram encourage creators to pay to target their content to particular types of viewers, while building an audience on TikTok is more organic, said Kellis Landrum, co-founder of Los Angeles marketing agency True North Social. TikTok influencer Ashley Dunham has been following news of the proposed ban carefully and has already made some adjustments to her social media strategy. ""I've been starting to post more of my content over on Instagram and it's surprisingly getting some traction,"" said Dunham, whose posts chronicle her experience with semaglutide (the active ingredient in Ozempic), plastic surgery and polycystic ovary syndrome. ""The one downside about Instagram is that it's always two weeks behind on trends."" The 33-year-old from Jacksonville, Fla., called the possible TikTok ban ""a disservice to not only creators but Americans as a whole,"" saying U.S.-based apps similarly collect personal data from users and can be manipulated. What would a ban mean for parents? Aside from the national security concerns surrounding China's access to TikTok users' personal data, the biggest complaint about the app is how well it holds the attention of young users. In Pew's survey last year, 17% of teens said they use TikTok almost constantly, and an additional 32% used it several times a day.  Other concerns are more safety related, including fears that TikTok's videos can fuel eating disorders and that the videos young people make of themselves will expose them to predators. The app's default settings try to address those concerns, although the settings can be changed or circumvented by determined users. If TikTok were to disappear tomorrow, that wouldn't stop kids from staring at their cellphones for hours on end. According to Pew's survey, 46% of teens said they were online almost constantly - far more than the percentage glued to TikTok. An additional 47% said they were online several times per day. And the complaints raised about TikTok in terms of its addictiveness, reinforcement of unhealthy behavior and risk of predation have been leveled at other social networks as well.

"February 26, 2024","Contemporary Artist Takes Aim at Wellness Culture for L.A. Exhibition: ""Art Can Be a Shift in Perception""",75,"  Wellness, self-help and ""woo woo"" culture are the backbone of Nora Turato's new exhibition so, naturally, it brings the contemporary artist to Los Angeles for her first West Coast outing. Hosted by Wilshire Boulevard gallery Sprüth Magers, it's not true!!! stop lying! runs from Feb. 28-April 27, and finds Turato playing with words and phrases by pulling text from about anywhere she finds inspiration - social media posts, commercials, movies, billboards and viral trends. She then places the text across enamel panels or paints them extra-large on walls. The former graphic designer even created a custom font for the pieces. One wall features the word ""authenticity"" and another ""haha"" in supersized letters. The enamel pieces showcase phrases like ""speaking my TRUTH!!!"", ""become pointless,"" ""SLEEP / it's good for you! and ""this isn't me / I need some healing."" The Croatia-born artist who is based in Amsterdam also zeroed in on movies like the Peter Sellers-starrer Being There, Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver and Todd Haynes' Safe starring Julianne Moore for additional pieces. For example, one reads, ""I'M GOING CLEAR / total organization is necessary!"" It was pulled from the scene in Taxi Driver that finds Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle flexing an arm and saying, ""From now on, it'll be total organization. Every muscle must be tight."" Turato's piece inspired by Taxi Driver. What does it all mean? Well, the answer is complicated. It's social commentary and critique, of course, but it's also personal. ""Basically, I'm interested in how can I expand my awareness of myself from within. I think that's kind of what all these things get at, and it comes naturally from me being involved with these [practices],"" says, referring to a journey of healing that started when she felt the pressure of a big show at New York's Museum of Modern Art a few years back. She had been working with veteran Hollywood dialect coach Julie Adams on a live performance piece that finds her playing many roles with varying vocal patterns. ""I was really tense in New York, and hit a wall and thought, OK, I need to get into therapy. I needed to start working on myself. I was asking myself, why am I not happy? It led me to want to look inward."" Turato did a deep dive into therapy, breath work, meditation, yoga, psychedelics to help her open up and ""make sense of things"" happening in her life, in the media and beyond. ""There's clarity that comes,"" she says, ""but once you start noticing all of the typography around you, all of these messages that you're constantly being fed, it can feel really intense and influence you on a subconscious level."" Language, she adds, ""can be like a mirror. One of the great things about being an artist is that you can always work out what you see in the reflection through your art. Art can be a shift in perception."" For ""authenticity"" and ""haha,"" she got inspired after noticing the push by advertisers to present an ideal of the authentic self. ""Be you or do you,"" she explains. ""I even saw a billboard for Jennifer Lopez's new album, 'This is Me...Now,"" which seems to be selling an identity. What is authentic? Not even babies are authentic, which is a very simple and basic thing. It's not Jennifer Lopez. Authentic is being sold to us as an identity, like an egoic interpretation of how you should be."" ' sleep / it's good for you!, 2024  Sprüth Magers will also a public reception for it's not true!!! stop lying! from 5-8 p.m. on Feb. 27, during which time Turato will present the themes as part of a live 40-minute performance piece that finds her metamorphosing into a series of characters all with distinct vocal intonations and body movements, similar to the MoMA show and originally commissioned by Performa, New York, in 2023. (The show is timed to Frieze Los Angeles, where Turato will also have a piece on view.) ""It's a bit like TikTok, switching channels or just scrolling,"" Turato explains of the performance. ""It uses that structure where you never really get anywhere but you're experiencing a story and then another story but you never finish it. It hypnotizes the mind."" It's Turato's first time on the West Coast and launching her show in L.A. feels like a perfect fit based on early feedback. ""Everyone kept telling me, 'Oh, this show is so L.A.,'"" she says with a laugh, while wearing an accessory she just picked up in the city, a blue baseball cap with the letters L.A. on it.

"March 7, 2024","     Copyright © Advisory Board Company & California Healthcare Foundation 2015, All Rights Reserved.     California HealthlineWhen It Comes to Ketamine, Meta's Posting Policy Is No Party to Decipher",76," People keep talking about ketamine. The drug has become a favorite of celebrities, billionaires, and ordinary patients, many of whom view it as a potential miracle drug for depression and other mental health conditions.     Whether on Facebook or Instagram, patients and clinics alike are giddy about the possibilities. But it is a drug that can be abused and can be deadly. Thus, ketamine is the latest challenge for Meta, the social media platforms' parent company, which for years has struggled to moderate posts and ads touting health-related products like weight loss supplements and dodgy covid-19 cures.     Still, despite warnings about the drug's dangers, Meta allows ads and posts about ketamine. Sometimes that chatter comes from sources that don't meet the conglomerate's voluminous standards, which, in theory, ensure posts are based on credible information.     Other internet ad networks are also trying to strike balances. Google says that because ketamine is a prescription drug, it can be advertised only if a provider is offering a prescription and is certified with a third-party oversight group; advertisers can't promote ""highs."" TikTok, which didn't reply to a request for comment, broadly prohibits advertising from unauthorized pharmacies or dispensaries, or advertising that features prescription drug abuse.     Meta's rules have created a conundrum for the company. Posts about ketamine, both a party drug and a possible mental health therapeutic, are governed by very different rules depending on the context, according to an investigation and report by the company's outside Oversight Board, an organization dubbed Facebook's ""Supreme Court"" for its role in refereeing the platform's speech regulations. That balancing act was on public display after a post about the substance was inspected repeatedly by the company's content review bureaucracy. When asked to comment for this article, Meta simply referred California Healthline to the board's report and the company's reply to the report.     This back-and-forth dates to December 2022, when a paid influencer posted on Instagram how the drug eased the influencer's ""treatment-resistant depression and anxiety."" The post described a ""magical entry into another dimension.""     After reviewing the paid post and Meta's rules on drug promotion, the Oversight Board found that the post inappropriately hyped the high of the drug, while not placing it in a medical context -- a problem, given the tension in the company's rules allowing discussion of pharmaceutical products and disallowing references to illicit drug use.     Ketamine, which is available in both liquid and powder form, emerged first as an anesthetic and became popular as a party drug because of its dissociative and hallucinogenic effects. It's FDA-approved as an anesthetic and, in some formulations, as a prescription antidepressant, to be administered in medically supervised settings. Regulated as a Schedule 3, nonnarcotic substance under the Controlled Substances Act, the drug has been shown to cause dependence, especially for people with a history of addiction to other substances. But researchers are intrigued by another aspect of ketamine: its mind-altering properties, which have potential therapeutic benefits.     These possibilities, aided by a boom in ketamine-focused medical startups and spas promoting the prescription drug as part of ""holistic healing"" or other wellness purposes, are fueling consumer interest, news coverage, and social media attention.     But there are indications of a dark side. According to an autopsy report from Los Angeles County's medical examiner department, actor Matthew Perry died with ketamine in his system as he reportedly was undergoing infusion therapy meant to treat depression and anxiety. Poison center reports of exposures involving ketamine surged just over 80% from 2019 through 2021, a study showed.     The tug of war is leading to conflicts between social media giants and advertisers. While Meta and its peers sometimes allow posts on the drug, they also include warnings. For example, if you search Instagram for ""ketamine,"" you learn the term ""may be associated with the sale of drugs"" and are offered a button to ""get help"" for substance abuse treatment. (You can also opt to get the results anyway.)     In 2023, hoping to resolve the situation, Meta referred the controversy concerning the post to its Oversight Board. The group has received $ 280 million in irrevocable funding since 2019. Membership includes former heads of state, prominent journalists, and human rights advocates.     For the ""magical entry"" post, according to a Meta missive cited in the board's report, the company expected the board would agree and open its platforms to more posting about mind-altering drugs with therapeutic potential. But the board instead offered pointed critiques and questions, threatening the status of other ketamine posts. The board argued that, based on the company's policies, the post inappropriately made ketamine seem like a ""high,"" rather than a medical experience.     ""This case indicates that Meta's strong restrictions on branded content promoting drugs and attempts to buy, sell, or trade drugs may be inconsistently enforced,"" the board concluded in its report.     Indeed, in a comment to the board, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy suggested it's easy to find sellers offering the drug for recreational use, citing two clear examples found ""with only a cursory search.""     The company's executives disagreed. When presenting the controversy to the board, they said they expected medical use of ketamine to increase, so it should allow the post. That led, in its response, to the company brushing off some of the board's suggestions, which could directly impact ketamine clinics' profits. After all, Facebook and Instagram audiences overlap with their clientele, and these ads are one of the main ways they promote their brands. Consider the money at stake. One recent academic review of ketamine clinics' advertising online, which was published in JAMA Network Open, found prices ranging from $ 360 to $ 2,500 per infusion.     When a particularly influential influencer posts about his clinic, there's ""a sharp uptick"" in interest ""every single time,"" Jacob Silverstone, the medical director of a ketamine infusion clinic outside Miami, told California Healthline. That interest often drives patients to his clinic, he said.     Still, despite the social media buzz, evidence for ketamine as a mental health treatment is unsettled.     ""Data from clinics strongly suggest that there's a benefit"" from the drug, said Boris Heifets, a Stanford University School of Medicine professor of anesthesiology studying ketamine and other psychiatric therapies like MDMA. Ketamine, some of these studies indicate, can work for depression -- even for patients who don't respond to conventional treatments like SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.     But, Heifets said, pop culture oversells the potential. On social media, some clinics promote practices without scientific backing, he said. ""It's not clear that they have any mental health expertise,"" he said.     Some clinic ads he has seen, Heifets said, dwell on the idea that the drugs act quickly and comprehensively -- avoiding the lack of good data about long-term therapeutic use.     The review of ketamine clinics' claims in ads on Google found the businesses rarely disclosed potential side effects, while aggressively marketing its benefits. Some ads falsely claimed the drug is nonaddictive, the review said.     Facebook and Instagram advertising can be similarly bullish about ketamine's potential. A fall 2023 search of Meta's ad library shows an armada of ketamine clinics with sunny claims, some promising ""rapid relief"" or telling viewers they can ""say goodbye to a once-daily SSRI"" or that ""IV ketamine can be your light in the darkness.""     These types of claims, while downplaying risks like substance use disorders, create outsize expectations in patients, Heifets said. ""You can create expectations for some of these kind of big interventions that if they're not met -- that can actually be disastrous for patients.""     The ads making such claims and minimizing or not mentioning the risks often appear to be slipping through a system with inconsistent regulations, and puzzling gaps, a review by California Healthline suggests.     Meta's policies require many advertisers who offer prescription drugs, and all advertisers offering drug and addiction treatment services, to undergo additional vetting by a group called LegitScript before they're allowed to hawk their wares or services on Facebook and Instagram. (Google similarly requires certification from an outside body like LegitScript for online pharmacies, telemedicine, and addiction services.) LegitScript reviews the advertisers' operations, like their clinical leadership and partnerships with pharmacies.     But in practice, ketamine advertisers often don't go through this process even if they fall into a category that should. California Healthline reviewed 27 advertisers on Meta in October and November 2023. Of those, 10 advertisers, spread over both months, either offered ketamine for drug addiction or ketamine via telehealth, and were not registered with LegitScript.     The online ads promote services, generally via telehealth, that prescribe ketamine -- often in a lozenge prepared by a compounding pharmacy. There's much less evidence for the safety and effectiveness of oral ketamine, Heifets said, compared with that of intravenously administered ketamine, which is more often studied.     Enforcement is on Meta's agenda. In its response to the Oversight Board on the ketamine case, Meta said it has improved its automated review tools for some advertisements promoting drugs, and pledged to consider auditing its policies in the first half of this year.     Federal regulators are showing signs of concern about ketamine, particularly when obtained online. Last year, the Drug Enforcement Administration shut down the telehealth practice of at least one physician who prescribed ketamine nationwide. In October 2023, the FDA issued a warning about compounded ketamine -- which these telehealth startups tend to rely on, Silverstone said.

"April 7, 2024",Dawn Porter on How She's Pivoted During the TV Downturn to Keep Telling Stories That Matter,78,"  ""I bring you news from America, where commissions are plentiful and they all come within two weeks,"" joked Dawn Porter, playing to the industry crowd at the international television market MIPTV on Sunday.  It got a big laugh. Everyone in the audience knows the reality: That theera of peak TV is past and that broadcasters and streamers are slashing their budgets for original programming. That decline is one of the reasons this will be the last MIPTV, with plans tomove MIP to London next year and dramatically downsize the storied TV market. The mood on the Croisette this year is practically funereal.  But Porter came to MIP not to bury the TV business but to praise it.  ""I'm sure that we're all quite aware of the difficulties of commissioning and the challenges in our market,"" she told the industry audience, ""but I want to stress that there's still quite a good path for quality filmmaking, and I'm really privileged to be a part of it."" Despite the broader decline in TV commissioning and financing, Porter, and her Trilogy Films outfit have had a stupendous year. Her documentary The Lady Bird Diaries, an archival footage doc about former first lady Claudia Alta ""Lady Bird"" Johnson, premiered at SXSW and was a hit for backers and distributors ABC News and Hula; her four-part Showtime original docu-series Deadlocked: How America Shaped the Supreme Court, picked up both independent spirit and critics choice award nominations; and Luther: Never Too Much, her look at the late great R&B legend Luther Vandross, was a Sundance standout.  But the non-fiction sector is still reeling from the pull-back by global streamers, who for years had plowed money into documentaries, spending millions to acquire indie docs out of festivals. Now that that funding has largely dried up - Luther: Never Too Much is still searching for a distributor - Porter said producers are being forced to be more creative in both their financing and storytelling. Both Lady Bird and Luther rely heavily on archive libraries - there's not a single new interview in Lady Bird - using old material to provide a new perspective on their subjects and their history. In another shift, both Lady Bird and Deadlocked were developed in close collaboration, and with development funding, from their respective commissioning broadcasters. ""I'm finding what commissioners are doing now is giving us a little bit more of development money in order to bring these stories to life,"" said Porter.  For her upcoming documentary project, Winnie and Nelson: Portrait of a Marriage, a look at the personal life on South African leader Nelson Mandela and his wife Winnie, Porter tapped private funding to develop the doc before going out wide to broadcasters. ""The first money in there is substantially from a private foundation,"" she said, ""which allows us to shape the story and to really dig into how it is going to be differentiated [from other documentaries about Mandela].""  Current market conditions are challenging, Porter admitted, but the appeal of non-fiction series and films, she argued, is undeniable.  ""The good news, the very good news, [is that] nonfiction is really resonating with the audiences and that's been recognized by so many broadcasters,"" Porter said.  This doesn't just mean more reality TV and celebrity docs. Porter's Lady Bird and Deadlocked - the latter is a four-part deep dive into the history of the right-wing shift at the U.S. Supreme Court, from the Nixon era to today - show there is a demand for provocative, complex and in-depth nonfiction.  ""Nonfiction long form does really, really well,"" Porter said, noting that work like hers can be an antidote to the scourge of social media-driven fake news. ""I think we need both. We need TikTok, Snapchat and wherever my kids get their news, things that may make them a little interested [in a subject]. But we also need the longer explanations. I'm finding people are actually relieved [watching my documentaries] that they can really sink into something and not have to digest it in just a few minutes.""

"March 20, 2024","De Los showcase at SXSW brings together love, family and Latinidad",79,"  As Los Aptos played onstage, two figures stood nearby, recording the performance on their phones. They were Juan Ortega Sr. and Leticia Ortega, who beamed from ear to ear as they watched their son, vocalist Juan Ortega Jr., sing the band's sierreño tracks. ""I'm so proud, I could cry,"" Juan, 54, said. ""I love music and always wanted to be a singer. Watching him up there is a dream come true."" The band, whose 40-minute set included a mixture of its own music and cover songs - from ""Miel"" to ""Devuelveme a Mi Chica"" by Los Hombres G - was part of the De Los showcase Friday night at the South By Southwest Music Festival in Austin, Texas. Ortega, 21, said the band, which drove nearly 17 hours from Indiana, was ""really happy and appreciative to be here."" ""We put in that work, so we're excited to turn the stage up,"" added Daniel Vaides, the band's keyboardist. The showcase, held at Latino-owned venue La Factoria, kicked off with Puerto Rican artist Nohemy, who shared that she played college basketball prior to pivoting to music.  Nohemy electrified the room with her self-proclaimed ""hype music,"" which included reggaeton track ""On Top"" and ""Calle,"" a song that had attendees chanting ""Traa! Traa!"" in between verses. ""Once I found out I was coming to [SXSW], and I was going to perform here with los L.A. Times, I was excited and stoked,"" she said. Toward the end of her set, Nohemy became emotional, explaining to the crowd that her next song, ""Lalala,"" was about being infatuated with another woman. She shared that her parents had not yet accepted her queer identity after she came out to them.  ""I have amazing parents, I respect everybody's beliefs. I just wanted to share that with you guys because maybe I would feel better,"" she said. Up next were the Tiarras, a trio formed by sisters Tiffany, Sophia and Tori Baltierra. The Austin-born siblings, whose dad was present to watch them rock out, delivered Chicana rock about empowerment, love and culture - with a special shout-out to the strong women for the ""path that you have paved for us."" That included a tribute to late singer Selena Quintanilla, as the Tiarras put their own spin on classic ""Como La Flor."" The sisters also performed ""Let Love Free,"" ""They Don't See Us"" and ""Soy Chingona,"" a song dedicated to confident Latinas. ""We're all for supporting Latinidad culture,"" Tori said of the all-Latino lineup. ""We are Mexican Americans. We are fourth generation, so it's awesome to be able to showcase with our own gente ... it means everything."" The third act of the evening was Bodine, a Miami-based Latin R&B artist who embraced sensuality and heartbreak in what was her fourth live performance ever. Wearing a silver-accented outfit, Bodine got the crowd dancing with tracks like ""Lo Nuestro""- a song about a first love whom she ""ended up hating"" toward the end of their time together. And then she turned up the heat with ""Nalgaje,"" a song she joked was about her favorite subject - the human rear. Bodine said there's plenty of more music on the way as she continues to work harder in the studio, and that she relished the opportunity to perform in front of a live crowd. ""I've been studying music as a kid, dreaming of representing Puerto Rico worldwide,"" she said. ""And I think this is a huge start here in Austin, Texas."" Friday marked Pink Pablo's last night at SXSW after a set at Rolling Stone's Future of Music showcase and Radio Day Stage on Wednesday. He greeted the crowd by beckoning them to come closer to the stage, adding, ""We're family here."" For his last performance, Pink Pablo sang ""Falco"" from his 2023 EP, ""road 2 neverland,"" as well as new single ""Low Key."" The Puerto Rico-born singer, whose music is a mixture of pop punk with urbano, left a potential career in psychology to fulfill his music dreams, and said he was at SXSW to make his mom proud. ""We're on the right track,"" he said. ""There's a lot of work to be done, but this feels gratifying. Very gratifying."" Sporting a red letterman jacket, Jalisco-born singer Polo González closed out the night with musica Mexicana. The TikTok personality opened with ""Caso Perdido"" and ""Fin de Semana,"" interacting between verses with a crowd that recorded every second of González's performance on their cellphones.  ""I always practice by myself at home, so performing in front of people and having them hear my songs - it's a testament to all the hard work,"" González said after his set, just as the lights came up.  The De Los showcase was among several at SXSW that focused exclusively on Latin music, which had a bigger presence at the festival than in previous years. One of the biggest stars at SXSW this year was Peso Pluma, who had fans lining up for hours to see him headline Rolling Stone's Future of Music showcase.

"February 26, 2024","Digital Creators Relish in Not Being ""the Only One in the Room"" at TikTok Visionary Voices Black Hollywood Brunch",81,"  Hotel Bel-Air was bustling with some of the internet's favorite content creators at the second annual TikTok Visionary Voices Black Hollywood Brunch in Los Angeles on Sunday afternoon. The event marked the celebration of the social media platform's 2024 Visionary Voices List, honoring 15 Black creators, small business owners and disruptors across industries.  ""I'm used to being one of one when I walk in the room, unfortunately, but in a room like today, I feel so much love because there's so many of us,"" Canadian pop star LU KALA (@igobylu), one of this year's honorees, said during a panel moderated by TikTok's #BlackTikTok community manager Alexzi Girma. Girma co-hosted the brunch with TikTok's global head of diversity and inclusion communications, Shavone Charles, who encouraged guests to stop by their first-ever experiential #ShopBlack installation, which included brands such as Topicals, Pat McGrath Labs, Ami Colé and FORVR Mood, as part of the platform's ongoing commitment to elevating Black creativity. During the panel discussion, LU KALA and fellow 2024 honorees Jordan Howlett (@jordan_the_stallion8) and Daven Gates (@onestopchop) each discussed how they found their voices on TikTok and what creating community has meant to them.  ""Growing up playing baseball, I was very much the only Black kid on the team for a lot of it, and you've got to teach yourself a lot if you don't have a lot of people that look like you around you,"" shared Howlett, who has a global reach of 23 million followers and is known for his humorous takes on life and recent viral interactions with Method Man and The Rock. ""The hardest thing for me was that I just needed guidance. I needed someone to be able to tell me that I could do these things, that people like me had done these things."" A former D1 athlete, Howlett explained that TikTok birthed new dreams for him when he leaned into the platform after his expectation of being drafted into Major League Baseball was derailed by the pandemic. ""Making these videos, the most rewarding thing is hearing people say that my videos make them feel like we're having a conversation and that they feel like they're wanted in this space. That's something that I wish I had from the age of 15 to 22."" As a Black female pop star, LU KALA related to Howlett's feeling of being an outsider. ""I didn't get to grow up and see people that look like me on the screen doing anything other than what people expect a lot of Black people to do,"" she said during the panel. ""I don't think different is rewarded, not in the beginning. I think in the long haul of the game, it will be rewarded, but in the beginning, I feel like we're all fighting to break down these barriers, so I feel like me winning means other girls, boys and people get to win alongside me."" Gates' motivation as a creator stems from being a father. His son, Cam, is often seen in his popular cooking videos. ""It's like taboo for a Black dad to be in the household so I try to represent fatherhood in a positive way so that he can see a positive image of me,"" he shared.  The importance of representation was a sentiment shared by other guests in attendance, including beauty influencer Jackie Aina (@jackieaina), who told The Hollywood Reporter, ""I use my voice to uplift the Black community by stepping into rooms and not being the only person.

"April 1, 2024",Donald Trump's Latest 'Cash Grab' Is Getting Criticism From Every Corner of the Internet,82,"  Donald Trump is juggling multiple civil and criminal cases along with his 2024 presidential campaign and it seems thatlife is getting expensive. While many Americans would look for a second job to pick up the slack, the former president is adding to his merchandise line in hopes that his voter base will add a bit of liquidity to his financial portfolio. To no one's surprise, avid Donald Trump critic John Oliver took the time from his Sunday, March 31 broadcast of Last Week Tonight to share his thoughts on the former president's latest merchandise drop. He's calling it a ""cash grab"" and he probably isn't wrong about this. ""This year, more than ever, everything Trump does is going to be a cash grab,"" Oliver explained, per Deadline. ""This year has been one of the few times he's actually been asked to pay the price for his actions but already, he's got other people footing the bill."" PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIA - FEBRUARY 17: Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump introduced his new line of signature shoes at Sneaker Con at the Philadelphia Convention Center on February 17, 2024 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  There's nothing like Donald Trump ""monetizing his bad behavior"" with his mugshot and the ""Not Guilty"" text on the front of a T-shirt - and yes, his fans are scooping up whatever he's selling. But Oliver noted the hypocrisy of it all. ""That is a man who talks non-stop about how he's one of the richest men on Earth, begging strangers for money in a hostage video that looks like it was filmed in a house haunted by the world's tackiest ghosts,"" he noted of Donald Trump's latest money plea video.  The former president has been hawking everything from shiny gold sneakers to cologne these days. It all seems random and rather haphazardly slapped together, but it's the Trump Bible that is fueling TikTok spoofs. Content creator Leah Knauer is having a field day taking a satirical look at the contents of the former president's Bible, turning pages with a tiny hand. ""And on the seventh day, Jesus filed for bankruptcy for the seventh time,"" she joked. ""That's my favorite from Chapter 11."" Her five videos have generated millions of views, so she clearly struck a nerve on the internet.  But Donald Trump knows his MAGA audience, and they continue to buy his merch. He's likely counting on them to defray some of his legal bills that are mounting at an astonishing pace. With more products likely coming down the pike, Donald Trump might be the most unexpected lifestyle influencer of 2024.

"March 20, 2024",Drake Bell gets apology from other Nickelodeon star who laughed at 'Quiet on Set' doc,83,"  Drake Bell received social media sympathy from former Nickelodeon actor Devon Werkheiser, who walked back his jokes about the alleged sexual abuse the ""Drake & Josh"" star and other actors experienced on-set. Werkheiser, star of ""Ned's Declassified,"" offered Bell an apology on X (formerly Twitter) on Tuesday, writing that he was ""gutted I hurt you."" Days after the bombshell ""Quiet on Set"" docuseries premiered, a clip of Werkheiser seemingly poking fun at the allegations of abuse and toxicity surrounding Dan Schneider and his sets went viral.  ""Get back in your hole Daniel, and give me holes,"" Werkheiser says in the video, ""sorry we shouldn't joke about this...Listen our set was not like that."" He added: ""It's f- awful, the Drake Bell s-....is crazy to hear, that is f-, man. And that never came out, which is really wild.""  Werkheiser, 33, and his ""Ned's Declassified Podcast Survival Guide"" co-hosts, including former co-star Lindsey Shaw, quickly faced backlash on X for ""poking fun at the abuse"" other actors allegedly faced on other Nickelodeon shows. While ""Ned's Declassified"" aired on Nickelodeon, it was not produced by Schneider's production company, which oversaw other hits including ""iCarly,"" ""Victorious"" and ""All That."" ""They should be standing beside their peers even if their set was different,"" wrote one X user, ""Yuck."" Alexa Nikolas, a former ""Zoey 101"" star and advocate for survivors of sexual abuse, wrote, ""really sad and disturbing to see some other Nick stars joking around and cracking jokes around child sexual abuse on tiktok."" Another X user defended Werkheiser, writing that the giggly TikTok clip was the ""Ned's"" stars' ""coping mechanism"" and their way to process the revelations from ""Quiet on Set."" Bell, however, had his own thoughts: ""Ned's Declassless,"" he tweeted on Monday, reposting Werkheiser's clip.  ""This is wild...laught it up guys...laught it up...,"" he wrote. ""'Give me your h*les?!!' Really?!"" In ""Quiet on Set,"" Bell broke his silence on the alleged sexual abuse he faced from Nickelodeon dialogue coach Brian Peck. Bell had worked with Peck on the set of ""All That"" and ""The Amanda Show.""  Peck was convicted of child abuse in 2004, but for years the victim's identity remained unknown. Bell said in the docuseries that the dialogue coach ""had pretty much worked his way into every aspect of my life.""  In response, Nickelodeon said in a statement, ""we are dismayed and saddened to learn of the trauma he has endured, and we commend and support the strength required to come forward."" Shortly after catching heat from both social media fans and Bell, Werkheiser acknowledged the impact of his comments and shared a statement.  ""I feel horrible that my dumba- was even speaking about this without seeing it,"" he wrote. ""I watched Quiet on Set tonight and am horrified by the gravity of what Drake and others shared."" He continued: ""Truly heartbroken about what my fellow actors went through. I can't believe they weren't protected. I'm sorry for compounding any hurt."" Bell has not acknowledged Werkheiser's apology.  Investigation Discovery's four-part ""Quiet on Set"" renewed interest and intrigue for the controversies surrounding Schneider's TV legacy. On Tuesday, the producer released a nearly 20-minute video acknowledging the documentary and addressing a range of allegations. Schneider denied that he hired Peck to his set and teared up as he recalled helping Bell's mother pen her speech for her testimony against the dialogue coach. ""That was probably the darkest part of my career,"" he said. Schneider concluded his video detailing what he could have done differently on his sets, from hiring a licensed therapist to advise young talent to changing ""how I would treat people and everyone."" ""When I watched the [docuseries], I could see the hurt in some people's eyes and it made me feel awful, and regretful and sorry,"" he said. ""I wish I could go back especially to those earlier years in my career and bring growth and the experience that I have now and just do a better job.""

"April 2, 2024","Drake Bell Says He Leaned on Josh Peck, Who ""Knew What Was Going On"" With Brian Peck",84,"  Drake Bell is thankful for his Drake & Josh co-star Josh Peck's support. After revealing on docuseries Quiet on Set that he was the previously unnamed minor who was sexually abused by actor and voice coach Brian Peck (no relation to Josh Peck), Bell spoke out on the podcast Not Skinny but Not Fat about how much Josh reaching out privately meant to him.  ""Josh worked on The Amanda Show, so he saw and knew what was going on,"" said Bell on the April 2 episode. ""I appreciate that he reached out to me privately and he didn't go straight to the media, because he was there with me and saw what I was going through."" Bell then clarified that he doesn't know if Josh knew specifics about the situation, but knew Bell had been abused by Brianand how ""sensitive"" it was for him at the time. ""Of course, watching the documentary, he learned so much of what I'd gone through that I think he was just so sensitive and made sure to reach out to me privately,"" said Bell.  After fans questioned why Josh hadn't openly supported his TV brother on social media following Quiet on Set, Bell made a TikTok explainin g that Josh had reached out privately. ""I just want to clear something up,"" he said in the TikTok. ""I've noticed a lot of comments on some of Josh's TikToks and some of his posts and I just want to let you guys know that processing this and going through this is a really emotional time and a lot of it is very, very difficult."" Bell continued, ""So not everything is put out to the public, but I just want you guys to know that he has reached out to me, and it's been very sensitive, but he has reached out to talk with me and help me work through this and has been really, really great. So I just wanted to let you guys know that and to take it a little easy on him."" Peck has also since spoken out publicly, explaining, ""I reached out to Drake privately, but wanted to give my support for the survivors who were brave enough to share their stories of emotional and physical abuse on Nickelodeon sets with the world."" He added that ""children should be protected,"" after watching the series about toxic working environments for child stars. Speaking about working under Dan Schneider on both The Amanda Show and Drake & Josh, Bell shared that his experience with the showrunner wasn't how it was described by other Nickelodeon stars on the docuseries. ""I can only speak to my experience and he was one of the few people that was really there for me during the time,"" said the actor.  Investigation Discovery is adding a fifth episode to the docuseries, premiering April 7. The special, titled Quiet on Set: Breaking the Silence, will be moderated by Soledad O'Brien and will delve deeper into the various claims of Nickelodeon creating a toxic workplace for the child stars and crew.  Bell is slated to return, alongside other network stars who appeared in the previous episodes, including Giovonnie Samuels and Bryan Hearne.

"March 20, 2024","Drake Bell Says Josh Peck Has ""Reached Out"" to Offer Support After He Revealed Abuse in Docuseries",85,"  Drake Bell shared that his Drake & Josh co-star Josh Peck has ""reached out"" to him, offering support after he revealed in Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV that he was abused.  In the harrowing four-part ID docuseries, the actor-musician shared his story of alleged abuse by his former dialogue coach, Brian Peck, who was convicted of sexually assaulting a Nickelodeon child actor in 2004. Viewers have now learned that Bell, who was a minor at 15 years of age at the time, was at the center of that criminal case and conviction. Following the revelations about allegations of abuse, some fans took to Josh Peck's social media to criticize him for staying silent. After Bell's stint on The Amanda Show from 1999 to 2002, he later starred alongside Josh Peck in the popular Nickelodeon show, Drake & Josh, for four seasons from 2004 to 2007. ""The silence is so loud Josh.. makes me sad,"" one person wrote in the comment section of Josh Peck's latest Instagram post from March 12, while another person added, ""The silence is disgusting."" On Tuesday, the day after the second part of the docuseries was released, Bell decided to take to TikTok to ask fans to ""take it a little easy"" on Josh Peck. ""I just want to clear something up,"" he said in the video. ""I've noticed a lot of comments on some of Josh's TikToks and some of his posts and I just want to let you guys know that processing this and going through this is a really emotional time and a lot of it is very, very difficult."" Bell continued, ""So not everything is put out to the public, but I just want you guys to know that he [Peck] has reached out to me, and it's been very sensitive, but he has reached out to talk with me and help me work through this and has been really, really great.

The actor admitted on a March 2022 episode of the podcast, BFFs with Dave Portnoy, Josh Richards and Brianna Chickenfry, that the pair were no longer friends.  ""We were kids, right? Obviously, there were times when we were closer than not, but when inevitably the show ended - I mean, we're just totally different kids,"" Josh Peck said at the time. ""Drake & Josh is something I'll be synonymous with forever, and I'm proud of it. And I want to like the guy that my name is attached to forever, but unfortunately, it just sort of worked out the way that it did."" The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to Josh Peck's rep for comment. The docuseries Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV also outlined allegations of abuse, sexism, racism and inappropriate behavior involving underage stars and crewmembers on Nickelodeon TV show sets overseen by Dan Schneider. Those programs included The Amanda Show, Drake & Josh, Zoey 101, iCarly, Victorious and Sam & Cat. Schneider has since broken his silence after watching the docuseries. It was also revealed that various actors and entertainment industry insiders, including Ron Melendez, Alan Thicke, James Marsden, Rider Strong and Will Friedle,wrote letters in support of Brian Peck, which were used to influence the judge during sentencing. Earlier this week, Bell called out Strong and Friedle, who starred in Boys Meets World, for not apologizing for their support of Brian Peck. Devon Werkheiser, who starred in Nickelodeon's Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide, also faced backlash this week for mocking the docuseries, but he later apologized.

"March 23, 2024","Drake Bell Was ""Cautious"" About Being Involved in 'Quiet on Set,' Checked Himself Into Rehab Before Docuseries",86,"  Drake Bell sat down for his first interview following the release of Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV, where he touched on everything from his hesitations about being a part of the docuseries to his father's involvement in it.  Early in Bell's interview on The Sarah Fraser Show (below), the actor-musician explained that he was originally ""cautious"" aboutparticipating in Quiet on Set because he had previously been approached about doing another documentary. When he declined, the response was ""unbelievable.""  ""They said that people like me were the problem, and this is why things aren't gonna change in the industry because people like you won't speak out and won't come forward,"" Bell explained about the previous project. ""It was just all this shaming of me not wanting to be a part of their documentary. So I've always been cautious and on-edge whenever approached to talk about such a sensitive topic."" When the Quiet on Set team originally reached out to him, he admitted he was hesitant to respond and even more reluctant to consider being in the docuseries. But, when he first interacted withone of the directors, Emma Schwartz, he felt more at ease.  ""She was very sensitive, and we kind of became buddies before [I agreed to participate],"" Bell said. ""I could tell that she was coming from a genuine place when we started our back-and-forth, and it wasn't of an angle of, 'OK, what do I have to say to get him involved? And I'll just say what I have to say to convince him.' I really felt a comfort with her. And so I said, 'You know if you're willing to come out to L.A. and sit down, at least I'll meet with you.'"" After Bell and Schwartz's first interview, he explained that he felt really comfortable with her but was going through so much in his personal life at the time, that he chose to go into rehab, where he underwent a lot of trauma therapy, in groups and one-on-one sessions.  ""Your entire day was filled with working through and processing this with a clear mind and unearthing all of these things that I hadn't faced head-on, or if I had tried to, it was too painful,"" he continued. ""And so through that process, once I got out, I thought to myself, 'Maybe this is a good time to reach back out to them and say, hey, I'm not 100 percent yet, let's talk some more, but I'm getting closer to feeling comfortable with finally sharing my story.'"" The Drake & Josh star revealed that his child sexual abuse at the hands of Brian Peck (unrelated to Josh Peck) didn't just affect him. It also affected his parents, siblings, nieces and nephews, admitting that it's something they've all had to deal with since it happened.  The actor went on to explain how his father, who makes an appearance in the docuseries, got involved with it. In the four-part documentary, Bell's father explained that Brian Peck started inching his way into his son's life, and he voiced his concerns to the producers, only to be accused of being homophobic.  ""My dad is a very emotional guy, and he has such a big heart, and I was very cautious about involving him,"" Bell said on the podcast, eventually deciding to include him because he thought ""maybe it would be cathartic and beneficial for my dad to be able to do [it as well]."" He added, tearing up, ""I'm sure that my dad puts a lot of blame on himself, you know? And I thought that this might be an opportunity for him to realize that, you know, that it's one person's fault."" In the lengthy podcast appearance, Bell also touched on how he felt about Nickelodeon's response that was shared in the doc.  ""It was a very well-tailored response saying, 'Learning about his trauma,' because they couldn't say that they didn't know about this or what had happened, or anything,"" he said. ""So I think that was a really well-tailored response by probably some big attorney in Hollywood."" He continued, ""I find it pretty empty, their responses, because, I mean, they still show our shows, they still put our shows on. And I have to pay for my own therapy. ... If there was anything, if there was any truth behind them actually caring, there would be something more than quotes on a page by obviously a legal representative telling them exactly how to tailor a response."" Later in the interview, Fraser asked Bell about his relationship with Dan Schneider, who served as the showrunner on several Nickelodeon series that ended up having allegations of abuse, sexism, racism and inappropriate behavior against them in the doc.  He shared that he had worked with Schneider for quite some time when the Brian Peck allegations first came out. While Bell didn't publicly reveal that he was the person the dialogue coach victimized until Quiet on Set, Schneider had an idea it was him and reached out. Due to their long-time working relationship, Bell felt comfortable admitting to Schneider that it was him.  ""He knew what I was probably dealing with, but I could tell in his voice that he got very, there was a lot of hurt and anger, but he was very sensitive to me, and that was my experience,"" Bell said. Adding, however, that his good relationship with Schneider doesn't make his fellow Nickelodeon stars' stories about the showrunner any less important or true.  He said, ""Watching the documentary, you hear the things that other people are saying, and you can't - especially with what I've been through - I can only react and respond to what I've actually experienced and also not say anything that would take away from somebody else having the comfortability and strength and bravery to tell their story and share their experiences.""  Toward the end of the podcast, Bell addressed some of the troubles he's faced over the years, including his child endangerment chargesin 2021 (which he addressed in the docuseries), being reported as ""missing and endangered""in 2023, and serving jail time for driving under the influence in 2016.  Fraser asked him if he realized while all of these things were happening that they may have been a result of his sexual abuse, or if it didn't click for him until he finally got help in the rehab he checked himself into. He explained it was a little bit of both and stated that The New York Times retracted its story that said he had been registered as a sex offender following the2021 charges. (The Times still has the story online but on March 18 added a correction at the bottom that noted he was given probation and community service, not registered as a sex offender.)  ""It's difficult. So, you're battling with things that are being said about you that are completely false and untrue, but you're being completely attacked for it,"" Bell said on the podcast. ""But also juxtaposing that, I have to take responsibility and accountability because nobody grabbed my hand and forced me to do those things - I mean other than Brian. But the decisions that I made are mine and mine alone, and you know you have to process that and work through it, but it's difficult at the same time when there's so much misinformation and lies and things being said about you.""

"March 7, 2024",Europe Enters New Era of Tech Regulation With Digital Markets Act,88,"  The Digital Markets Act(DMA), the new European Union rules that aim to rewrite how business is done online by regulating how the world's biggest tech companies operate, take effect today, Thursday, March 7. The regulation applies to companies with a market value of (EURO)75 billion ($81.7 billion) or (EURO)7.5 billion ($8.17 billion) in annual revenue within the EU, and at least 45 million monthly end-users and 10,000 yearly business users of at least one core platform, including web browsers and virtual assistants.  The DMA will initially apply to six companies, designated as ""gatekeepers"" for their supposed dominate positions in areas of the digital marketplace: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft. The EU has also designated 22 core platform services of these tech giants -Meta's Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, ByteDance's TikTok, Google's search service, etc. -as coming under the scope of the new regulations. It will be months, if not years, before the usefulness and the unintended consequences of the EU legislation will become clear, but already the DMA has forced tech giants, from Alphabet to TikTok, to change how they operate in the EU or face the threat of hefty fines. First-time DMA offenders can be penalized up to 10 percent of their company's total worldwide turnover. For repeat infringements of the law, the EU can levy a 20 percent fine. For Meta, for example, that would mean a fine of $13.4 billion, 10 percent of the company's 2023 worldwide revenue of $134 billion, for its first offense. The legislation is one of the world's toughest pieces of legislation targeting the market clout of tech firms and could mark a sea change in how Europe does regulation. Instead of waiting to see evidence of market dominance hurting consumers and using traditional antitrust law to correct it - the approach taken by U.S. regulators to reign in big tech - with the DMA, Europe is trying to get ahead of digital markets by erecting guardrails requiring the biggest players in the tech world to open up their systems to competition to ensure, in the words of the European Commission, ""a level playing field"" for businesses in the digital sector. EU legislators see anti-trust as ""too slow"" to deal with the rapidly changing digital marketplace, says Enrique Dans, a professor of innovation at Madrid's IE University and a non-resident fellow with the digital innovation initiative at the think tank the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA) Governments across the globe seem to agree with Brussels. Before Europe's law even went into effect, and before the full impact of the legislation could be assessed, governments around the globe, from the U.K. to Japan, were rushing to write their own copycat versions of the DMA. ""What we're seeing,"" says CEPA senior fellow Bill Echikson, ""is the 'Brussels Effect,' the effect of Brussels wanting to be the world's tech regulator. It happened with the privacy GDPR law in 2018 [which] has been copied around the world. And already we're seeing copies of this Digital Markets Act, or variations of it appear in places like Japan, the U.K., Brazil, Mexico, even India. I think, in the democratic world [the DMA] will become the de facto standard."" Some DMA copycat legislation, like that proposed in Japan, is more targeted and narrower in scope than the DMA, while other governments, notably in the U.K., want tougher regulation. Britain's proposed Digital Markets Competition and Consumers Bill goes further than the DMA, requiring tech giants, among other things, to open up their data to rival search engines, increase their battle against fake online reviews, and overhaul their app stores, to comply. As if to show it means business, the European Union on Monday, March 4, leveled an antitrust penalty against Apple, fining the company nearly $2 billion for breaking competition laws by unfairly favoring its own music streaming service over rivals. The case against Apple was brought by a group of smaller tech companies led by Swedish music streaming service Spotify. Google recently received a (EURO)2.42 billion ($2.64 billion) antitrust fine from the EU for using its own price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals. Both Apple and Google are appealing the penalties. The DMA comes alongside another piece of sweeping EU legislation, the Digital Services Act (DSA), which focuses on consumer protection. The scope of the DMA and the hefty penalties it allows could mean the legislation will have a major impact on the development of digital industries worldwide. But the EU's new laws still leave out certain digital markets, including video streaming, from anti-trust consideration.

"March 15, 2024",Europe Stakes Claim as the World's Digital Cop,89,"  Europe is staking its claim to be the world's digital cop, with a series of new laws aimed at regulating the world's biggest tech companies. Following last year's Digital Services Act, which targeted abuse on social media, comes the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which went into effect on March 7 and has the much broader goal of combating unfair competition and preventing market dominance by so-called digital ""gatekeepers,"" a who's who of Internet behemoths, from Alphabet and Apple to Meta, Microsoft and TikTok. [This week, the European Parliament also passed the AI Act, the world's first broad legislation regulating artificial intelligence, but those laws won'tfully take effectuntil mid-2026.]  The DMA is already transforming how big tech does business in Europe, and given that EU digital laws tend to become global standards - what Anu Bradford of Columbia Law School has called the ""Brussels effect"" - Europe has become a testing ground for the future of digital markets, impacting everything from how video games are sold online to the information available for use in targeted advertising to the ease with which users can communicate between platforms and devices, whether its sending videos from an iPhone to an Android device or texting between iMessenger and WhatsApp. The legislation is complicated but, in general, platforms designated as ""gatekeepers"" - those with a market value of (EURO)75 billion ($81.7 billion) or annual revenue of at least (EURO)7.5 billion ($8.17 billion) within the EU, and at least 45 million monthly end-users on at least one core platform - are required to take proactive steps to ensure their services treat competitors fairly and to allow customers to pick and choose among digital services, whatever hardware or operating system they are using. The DMA will initially apply to six ""gatekeeper"" companies: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, TikTok owner ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft. Instead of waiting to see evidence of market dominance hurting consumers and using traditional antitrust law to correct it - the approach taken by U.S. regulators to reign in big tech - Europe is trying to get ahead of digital markets to ensure, in the words of the European Commission, ""a level playing field"" for businesses in the digital sector. Europe is going further than the U.S. has when it comes to digital regulation, but not so far as to ban individual services or platforms, as a bill thatjust past the House of Representatives would do for TikTok if ByteDance refuses to sell its U.S. operations.  In Europe, the message for tech giants is ""with power comes responsibility"" said EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager, speaking at SXSW on March 11. And Europe is ready to punish companies that act irresponsibly. The DMA includes penalties allowing the EU to fine first-time DMA offenders up to 10 percent of their company's total worldwide turnover and double that for repeat infringements. To get an idea of the scale of these punishments: If Meta broke the DMA rules, it could cost the company $13.4 billion (10 percent of the company's 2023 worldwide revenue of $134 billion) for its first offense. As if to show it means business, on March 4 the EU levied a (EURO)1.8 billion ($2 billion) fine on Apple for unfairly favoring its own music streaming service by forbidding rivals like Spotify from telling users how they could pay for cheaper subscriptions outside of iPhone apps. In a separate antitrust action against Google, the EU filed the company (EURO)2.42 billion ($2.64 billion) for favoring its own price comparison shopping service over smaller European rivals. Both Apple and Google are appealing the penalties. But in a similar DMA-related dispute with Epic Games, producers of Fortnite, Apple backed down, reversing a previous decision to block an Epic Games app store for iOS that would circumvent Apple's online stores. In a tweet on March 9, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney said Apple's reversal marked a ""big win for European rule of law."" On its website, Epic Games said it sent a strong signal ""that the European Commission will act swiftly to enforce the Digital Markets Act and hold gatekeepers accountable."" Before Europe's law even went into effect, and before the full impact of the legislation could be assessed, governments from London to Tokyo were rushing to write their own copycat versions of the DMA. It's a repeat of what happened with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) privacy law, enacted in 2018, which became the model for at least 150 similar regulations worldwide, including California's Consumer Privacy Act. ""Already we're seeing copies of this Digital Markets Act, or variations of it, appear in places like Japan, the U.K., Brazil, Mexico, even India,"" says Bill Echikson, a senior fellow with the think tank the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA). ""I think, in the democratic world [the DMA] will become the de facto standard."" Smaller media companies, particularly in Europe, are hopeful the DMA will allow them to break the hold the international giants have on the digital market. Ahead of the legislation, Germany's top two commercial TV companies, RTL Deutschland and ProSiebenSat.1 launched a joint adtech partnership to offer broadcasters and publishers across Europe the ability to do cross-platform ad campaigns ""independent of the U.S. tech giants."" But Echikson warns the DMA might have the opposite effect and actually help ""reinforce the gatekeepers"" because the global tech giants will be able to use their dominant position to squeeze out their competitors. ""On DMA, what I've been hearing is, the changes Google is making in search, for example, will mean people will need to spend more on advertising to make sure that they stay at the top of the search results, [so] Google could get more business out of this,"" says Echikson. ""I'm not sure [the DMA] is going to succeed, particularly in opening the market to European competitors."" The E.U.'s Regulatory Crackdown: The Highlights  July 2021 - Amazon fined (EURO)746 million ($888 million) for violating EU data protection rules (GDPR). September 2022 - Google fined (EURO)4.12 billion ($4.13 billion) for using its Android mobile operating system to thwart rivals. April 2023 - Ireland's data regulator fined TikTok (EURO)345 million ($377 million) for breaking EU data law in its handling of children's accounts. May 2023 - Meta fined (EURO)1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) for violating GDPR. June 2023 - Microsoft discloses it has set aside $425 million in anticipation of a fine it expects to receive from Ireland's data regulator for violations of GDPR by its LinkedIn subsidiary. March 2024 - Apple fined (EURO)1.8 billion ($2 billion) over abusive App store rules for music streaming providers. (Note: Fines may be reduced or overturned on appeal.)

"March 30, 2024",Every Actor Who Has Spoken Out Following 'Quiet on Set' Revelations,90,"  Drake Bell, Josh Peck, Kenan Thompson and Alexa Nikolas are among numerous former Nickelodeon stars who spoke out following the harrowing allegations revealed in Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV. Investigation Discovery's four-part docuseries outlines allegations of abuse, sexism, racism and inappropriate behavior involving underage stars and crewmembers on Nickelodeon TV show sets run by Dan Schneider. Some of the programs mentioned included The Amanda Show, Drake & Josh, Zoey 101, iCarly, Victorious and Sam & Cat. In the series, former creatives and crewmembers detailed their experiences behind the camera, claiming they endured toxic workplaces. Amanda Bynes, who was a prominent young figure on Nickelodeon in the 1990s and early 2000s, starring in The Amanda Show and All That, was also frequently mentioned throughout, although she did not participate in the docuseries. Below, The Hollywood Reporter has compiled comments made by former Nickelodeon actors following the release of Quiet on Set. Drake Bell In the third episode of the docuseries, Drake & Josh star Drake Bell shared his story for the first time of alleged abuse he experienced at the hands of his former dialogue coach, Brian Peck, who was convicted of sexually assaulting a Nickelodeon child actor in 2004. At the time, the minor was referred to as John Doe in court documents. He graphically recounted the abuse in the doc, saying, ""It just got worse and worse and worse and ... worse, and I was just trapped and I had no way out."" Days later, in his first interview after the ID project aired, Bell also opened up about his hesitations before doing Quiet on Set as well as Nickelodeon's ""empty"" response, adding that it ""was a very well-tailored response saying, 'Learning about his trauma,' because they couldn't say that they didn't know about this or what had happened, or anything."" Following the docuseries' release, Bell sharedthat his Drake & Josh co-star Josh Peck (who's not related to Brian Peck) ""reached out to talk with me and help me work through this and has been really, really great."" Josh Peck  On March 22, Josh Peck broke his silence about Quiet on Set, noting that it ""took a few days to process it."" He added in an Instagram post, ""I reached out to Drake privately, but wanted to give my support for the survivors who were brave enough to share their stories of emotional and physical abuse on Nickelodeon sets with the world. Children should be protected. Reliving this publicly is incredibly difficult, but I hope it can bring healing for the victims and their families as well as necessary change to our industry."" Nancy Sullivan Nancy Sullivan, the actress who played Drake's mother Audrey on Drake & Josh, has also shared her support for Bell. ""It broke my heart into a million pieces to hear just how much Drake was holding inside while we were working together,"" she wrote in part on social media. ""I was both devastated and proud seeing the man he's grown into sit down on camera and bravely tell his truth."" Devon Werkheiser, Lindsey Shaw and Daniel Curtis Lee After receiving backlash for a joke they seemingly made about Bell, Ned's Declassified School Survivor's Guide stars Devon Werkheiser, Lindsey Shaw and Daniel Curtis Lee took to their podcast to express their regrets over the joke, as well as to address the docuseries as a whole. Werkheiser, who previously apologized to Bell on X (formerly Twitter), admitted that the trio hadn't yet seen Quiet on Set when they made the ""super shit"" joke, adding, ""Everyone was asking us for our opinions on it, and I get it. Now, having seen the documentary, it's so disturbing. Now, we've watched it, and I get it. If I had just watched especially that third episode and then watched us joking like that ... I would be like, 'Are they sociopaths? Is something wrong with them?'"" Shaw also noted that they shouldn't have joked about the docuseries in any capacity and been insensitive to what other people have struggled with. ""I hate that this happened,"" she said. ""I hate that we compounded any trauma around this situation that means so much to each of us. I am sorry."" Steve Burns Former Blue's Clues host Steve Burns also shared a few words on the matter, making space for his (now grown-up) fans to share how they were feeling.  ""Hey, I'm checking in,"" he said in a TikTok. ""Tell me what's going on."" Burns then waited for a response, staring into the camera for a minute before finishing with, ""OK. Alright, well, it's good to hear from you. You look great, by the way."" Alexa Nikolas Zoey 101 alum Alexa Nikolas, who was among the Nickelodeon stars to appear in Quiet on Set, has remained vocal following the docuseries' release. She released a YouTube video reacting to Schneider's response to the series, noting that she didn't think he was fully taking responsibility for his harmful actions. ""I'm going to cut to the chase here: You don't feel anything, Dan. You have no idea what accountability is. You're searching for it, maybe, but you haven't landed on it. That's for sure. This is not the way,"" she said.  Speaking with THR, Nikolas expanded on her own alleged experiences with Schneider on the set of Zoey 101, including a situation that led to her deciding to leave the show for its third season.  Allie DiMeco Allie DiMeco, the actress who starred in The Naked Brothers Band as Rosalina, spoke up about her own experiences since the release of the docuseries. She made a TikTok saying she was ""stressed"" while watching Quiet on Set, as she also went through her own trauma on the Nickelodeon series. ""There was an episode where Rosalina 'cheated' on Nat and kind of kissed a French guy,"" she explained, adding that she ""did not"" want to kiss him. ""He's a 30-year-old man. I'm sorry, I couldn't even watch it. It gives me fucking the ick, and it honestly gives me PTSD,"" DiMeco said while playing an edited version of the show's clip in question.  She added that she told the Naked Brothers Band crew ""many times that I didn't want to do it. My mom was very against it and they pretty much made me feel like I was going to lose my job, that I might be fired if I didn't do it."" Matt Bennett Matt Bennett, an actor and DJ who starred in Victorious as Robbie Shapiro,shared a statement on his Instagram Story, speaking out in support of the fellow Nickelodeon stars. He mentioned that, like many of the network's fans, he had watched Quiet on Set. As someone who was part of a hit series on the network, he said he spent his time watching the docuseries ""trying to remove myself from the situation, asking, 'If I hadn't worked for Nickelodeon and didn't know any of the people involved, would I be OK with the behavior and the treatment of others I'm seeing?'"" He realized that the answer was ""No, I wouldn't be ok with it and I'm not OK with it."" Bennett then noted that processing what occurred to the fellow Nickelodeon child stars is ""a little too real for me right now and there are some mental pretzels"" he has to work on undoing. He additionally shared that he's dedicated to ""help in any way I can to put more safeguards in place to protect young actors.""  Kenan Thompson While appearing on The Tamron Hall Showon March 27, Kenan Thompson, who started his career on All That and then starred in his own show Kenan & Kel, also voiced his support. He said that though he did not share the same experiences as other Nickelodeon stars, he stands by their decision to speak out. Because all these things happened after I left, basically, and Dan [Schneider] wasn't really on Kenan & Kel like that. I mean, he got a 'created by' credit, but it was a different showrunner. So our worlds weren't really overlapping outside of all that, necessarily. And then all that negativity kind of started happening outside of our tenure there,"" Thompson explained. He added, ""I think it's a good thing that the doc is out, and it's putting things on display that need to be, you know, stories that need to be told for this, accountability sake. But it's definitely tough to watch because I have fond memories of that place, and I have fond memories of my co-stars and stuff like that. So to hear that they've gone through terrible things like that, it's just, it's really tough.??"" Chris Massey Meanwhile, after his mother took to Instagram to defend Dan Schneider, calling him a ""genius"" and asking for the blame to be placed on the parents instead of the showrunner, Zoey 101 star Chris Massey released his own statement on the social media platform. He wrote, ""My story will be told from me.... not from a parent, a friend, a co-worker... ME!!! and only ME... so please stop messaging me about what my mom said... respectfully."" The first four episodes of Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV are currently streaming on Max, with a fifth episode, Breaking the Silence, airing on April 7.

"March 1, 2024",Exclusive: Sarah Michelle Gellar Opens Up About the 'Beautiful But Stressful' Parts of Parenting & It's So True,91,"  If anyone says parenting is wonderful all the time, they're lying. Or they don't actually have kids. Because all parents know that it's equal parts amazing and frustrating, lovely and chaotic, exhilarating and mind-numbingly boring. (Nobody but toddlers can watch the same show for 47 times without wanting to claw their eyes out, OK?) Sarah Michelle Gellar summed it up in a new interview with SheKnows, where she called motherhood ""beautiful but stressful"" - and I've never related to anything more. Mindset Change LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 19: Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr. attend the ""Wolf Pack"" Premiere on January 19, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Jesse Grant/Getty Images for Paramount+) The Buffy The Vampire Slayer alum's oldest child Charlotte is 14, so she and husband Freddie Prinze Jr. have been doing this whole ""raising kids"" thing for a while. (They are also parents to son Rocky, 11.) ""I think, ultimately, it's just sort of a change in mindset,"" Gellar says, when I asked what she's learned about motherhood over the years. ""Because even though I was married for ten years [before Rocky was born], my husband was an adult, and I knew he could take care of himself.""  She explains, ""But all of a sudden, in your mind, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, you're worried about these little beings in an incredibly all consuming, beautiful but stressful way."" Check out Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr.'s amazing summer adventure in Florence, Italy! ? https://t.co/GBrDiTlSu4 - SheKnows (@SheKnows) July 19, 2023 Yes! And even if you have tons of help, becoming a guardian of a precious infant or two feels incredibly overwhelming. What do you mean this baby is my responsibility 24/7? I remember thinking when my eldest was born. I felt like I needed a grown up to help, but there was just me. It's like being thrown in the ring of fire, and yes, it's beautiful, but that doesn't negate how challenging it is, too! Speaking of challenges, Gellar has also faced her fair share of those. ""That's what's funny about the challenges of being a parent ... it always seems like the hardest part. And then you get to the next part, and you're like, 'Oh, this is harder,'"" she tells us. ""I don't think it ever changes."" Technology Rules SANTA MONICA, CA - SEPTEMBER 27: Actress Sarah Michelle Gellar (L) and her son Rocky James Prinze attend the Mattel Party On The Pier at Santa Monica Pier on September 27, 2015 in Santa Monica, California. (Photo by Mike Windle/Getty Images for Mattel UCLA Children's Hospital) A new issue she and her Scooby Doo co-star husband are facing with their kids revolves around technology. This is hard ""especially because we have no roadmap,"" Gellar says. ""There are certain things where we can ask people that have been through it, 'How did you handle this when I was a kid?' But this is a new frontier. And so we're really sort of learning as we go, and I think that's always incredibly challenging."" One way she is handling this is by making sure her kids get lots of break from technology. The Wolf Pack actress does this by setting time limits for screen time. ""I think it's a big ask to expect our children to be able to self-regulate at this age,"" she explains. ""My son's younger, so there's websites I don't want him on,"" she continues. ""Being able to block that is great. And hopefully, our idea is that by doing that, it will become a habit, and that eventually, when they're on their own with their devices, they'll be able to self-regulate and understand how much time they're on their devices."" Setting an Example HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA - SEPTEMBER 14: (L-R) Sarah Michelle Gellar and Charlotte Grace Prinze attend the Do Revenge LA Special Screening post reception at the Hollywood Roosevelt on September 14, 2022 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for Netflix) She and Prinze also do their best to set an example for their kids. ""My husband and I, we sit down for dinner at the table. There are no phones,"" Gellar says. ""We will all watch a show together. There are no phones. It's those moments where we set the example. We connect. We make eye contact."" Even when technology might be useful, Gellar still sets limits. ""If they want help with their homework, we put our phone away and we sit down and we help them,"" she says. ""And even when they say, 'Well, can you just look up the answer on the phone?' We'll be like, 'No, we're gonna figure out the answer and the problem, and we're gonna work through it.'"" Taking Breaks Sarah Michelle Gellar at the 15 Years of Siriano Party at Nic's On Beverly on November 2, 2023 in Los Angeles, California (Photo by Gilbert Flores/WWD via Getty Images) Gellar's strong belief in technology breaks is the reason she partnered with UScellular to encourage people to participate in the Global Day of Unplugging on March 1. ""I hope that everyone joins myself and UScellular for Global Day of Unplugging on March 1 and takes this global break, because you'll realize how much better you feel, and you sort of understand your relationship with technology in a different way,"" she says. Gellar encourages everyone to follow her example and go to uscellular.com/unplugging and share UScellular's Global Day of Unplugging image on your social channels today. For every share, UScellular will make a donation up to $10,000 to Unplug Collaborative. You will also see tips and resources to help you disconnect.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Sarah Michelle (@sarahmgellar) ""I think it's important for everybody to take breaks,"" she says, sharing that breaks help us ""realize how much time we're spending on our devices.""  ""We're all guilty of it,"" Gellar continues. ""I lead a wonderful life. I still get jealous sometimes of people's trips or things I see on social media. We're human, and it's about separating that and also understanding that when we spend too much time looking down, we're not looking up. And looking up is beautiful."" We couldn't agree more.

"December 30, 2023",Fans Are Loving This Viral Clip of Princess Charlotte's Sweet Gesture for This Fellow Royal Kid,92,"  Princess Charlotte has been compared to her late grandmother, Princess Diana, many times during her eight years of life, and she's going viral once again for yet another Diana-ism. On Christmas Day, the royal family partook in their annual walk to and from the St Mary Magdalene Church service. All three of Prince William and Kate Middleton's children - Prince George, 10, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis, 5 - were present for the gathering, as were Zara and Mike Tindall's eldest kids, daughters Mia, 9, and Lena, 5. SANDRINGHAM, NORFOLK - DECEMBER 25: Princess Charlotte of Wales and Mia Tindall attend the Christmas Morning Service at Sandringham Church on December 25, 2023 in Sandringham, Norfolk. Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage. While the Tindalls walked hand in hand with Lena, Mia joined the Wales family toward the front of the procession as they greeted well-wishers and accepted gifts. One fan captured a particularly sweet moment on camera between Mia and Charlotte, which has gone viral with nearly 5 million views on TikTok in the few days since.  While their parents chatted with the crowd, the royal kiddos were busy collecting presents from adoring onlookers. In the viral clip, George is seen walking off camera toward the line of people alongside the path, then coming back into the frame with a large teddy bear, which he immediately shows Louis. Charlotte and Mia then enter the picture, with Mia holding a bouquet of roses and Charlotte holding an assortment of items, including her own colorful bundle of flowers. Princess Charlotte looks so much like her late grandmother, Princess Diana. ? https://t.co/nKPx5kWB5b - SheKnows (@SheKnows) May 18, 2023 A well-wisher captures Mia's attention as they hold out another bouquet, indicating that it's a gift for Charlotte. The eldest Tindall kid turns toward her cousin, seemingly communicating that the bundle is for her, and Charlotte smiles and sweetly says, ""You can get it for me, Mia."" The moment of kindness and inclusivity is undoubtedly similar to the generosity and warmth Diana was known for, making the wholesome moment between cousins that much more precious. Fans swooned over Charlotte's thoughtful gesture, with one person commenting, ""charlotte let mia take the flower at the end omg what a beautiful soul."" Other TikTok users wrote, ""Charlotte is pure royalty ?,"" ""They really are the sweetest most well-behaved kids ever,"" and ""Charlotte is an absolute doll,"" among other doting sentiments.

"February 24, 2024",Fans Are Seriously Split on How They Feel About Kourtney Kardashian & Travis Barker Making Out Next to Daughter PenelopeFans Are Seriously Split on How They Feel About Kourtney Kardashian & Travis Barker Making Out Next to Daughter Penelope,93,"  Kourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker's over-the-top PDA has landed them in controversy ever since they got together, but now fans are calling them out for doing so in front of one of their kids. In a TikTok clip posted from the new outlet @news.com.au_ents, we see Kardashian, Barker, and Kardashian's daughter Penelope backstage at the blink-182 concert, with Kardashian going in to give Barker a huge smooch. The outlet posted the 37-second clip with the caption reading, 'Get a room,'"" with the laugh-crying emoji, and adding, ""Kourt is the loving and supportive partner we all need."" In the controversial clip, many have called out both Kardashian's and Barker's behavior behind the scenes. While they, and their daughter Penelope walk around, Kardashian and Barker trail off to give each other kisses, and then make out, with Penelope awkwardly standing there. Then, at one point, Penelope walks off to the side, and in the video shared, fans couldn't see if Kardashian looked in her daughter's direction. So it's no secret that Kardashian and Barker have been at the center of controversy for years now for their extreme PDA moments on the red carpet and on social media, but now, fans have a problem with their PDA in front of one of their kids. This video has started a blaze of controversy, with many pointing out why it's a problem to make out and seemingly ignore your child. (We're not saying this is what happened, we are just relaying what many fans have had problems with.) In fact, many feel sympathy for Penelope because she looks so awkward standing there, and many are hoping that she's okay. Many TikTok users commented under the video saying, ""Poor P just standing there while they exchange spit,"" ""Love how the kid is ignored,"" and ""Penelopeis not comfortable."" However, quite a few fans have also just praised Kardashian and Barker for seeming so in love and happy together, after their very public relationships from before were seemingly toxic. Something to keep in mind is that, yes, Penelope doesn't exactly look comfortable being next to her parents making out, but it's a 30-second clip from a few hours of a night. Only the three of them really know what happened. For those who don't know, Kourtneyand Barker have seven children in total. Barker shares Alabama, 18, Landon, 20, and stepdaughter Atiana, 24, with ex Shanna Moakler, and Kardashian shares Mason, 14, Penelope, 11, and Reign, 9, who she shares with ex Scott Disick. And then Barker and Kardashian welcomed their newborn son Rocky!

"March 17, 2024",Flamin' Hot Cheetos and iPhones are ruining our kids,94,"  With apologies to Allen Ginsberg: I am seeing the best minds of our middle-school generation destroyed by Flamin' Hot Cheetos and iPhones, Teenagers on the cusp of young adulthood dragging themselves out of bed each day to mainline TikTok and Snapchat, Measuring themselves by the yardstick of uber-filtered Kardashian perfection and falling short, Getting expelled from school for sending AI-generated naked photos of classmates. I want to howl about what's happening to our kids. Between the negative brain effects of ultra-processed foods, and what can only be described as smartphone use disorder, something has gone terribly awry. As it happens, you've caught me at a bad moment. In our home lately, the 13-year-old and I seem to be having daily conflicts over food and phones. When she moved in with me at age 8, she had a smartphone, which I immediately put away. Her preference for ultra-processed food was already well-established; she'd been raised on a diet heavy on fast food and Lunchables. We very consciously waited until eighth grade to get her an iPhone, as recommended by many childhood experts, but I honestly don't think we waited long enough. Her first, non-smart phone allowed her to take pictures, make calls and text, but had no internet functions. In my view, it was perfect. In hers, an embarrassment. When her iPhone arrived at the beginning of this school year, everything changed. Although we made a contract outlining the rules, her phone was never out of sight. Even when it was supposed to be put away, surreptitious use continued -- in the classroom and at the dinner table. It became an appendage. Taking away the phone as a consequence of breaking the rules, a stipulation in our contract, resulted in meltdowns. How are young teenagers supposed to regulate their phone use when they haven't yet figured out how to regulate their moods or relationships? Giving a kid a smartphone is like putting a bomb in their hands and hoping it never goes off. I am worn down trying to monitor my niece's phone behavior and making sure she consumes a diet that will not turn her into a diabetic teenager. (No, I am not fat shaming anyone! I am pointing out that there is a relationship between the quality of food we eat, what we drink and the state of our health.) On Monday, I opened the Wall Street Journal to find a story with an illustration of a human brain made entirely of Cheetos. They should have added an image of what your kids' hands look like after consuming a bag of them. Or your furniture. ""Ultra-processed foods may not only affect our bodies,"" the story began, ""but our brains too. New research suggests links between ultra-processed foods -- such as chips, many cereals and most packaged snacks at the grocery store -- and changes in the way we learn, remember and feel."" Because the foods mimic other addictive substances, the story said, ""some scientists are proposing a new mental-health condition called 'ultra-processed food disorder.' "" And so I give thanks to California lawmakers for being willing to consider a bill that would ban from public schools foods that contain artificial dyes that have been linked to brain changes. No one is suggesting that all these foods should be banned for everyone, all the time; only that, like sugary sodas, they should not be on offer or for sale at school during school hours. Each weekday morning, I drop off my niece at school and watch as nearly every kid shuffles along, head down, eyes focused not on the world around them, but on their smartphones. They cross the street looking at their smartphones. They stand in clumps looking at their smartphones. When I pick her up in the afternoon, same thing. Last week in the Atlantic, Jonathan Haidt, a social psychologist at New York University's Stern School of Business proposed that smartphones have changed the very nature of childhood -- and not for the better. ""What is childhood -- including adolescence -- and how did it change when smartphones moved to the center of it?"" Haidt asks. ""If we take a more holistic view of what childhood is and what young children, tweens, and teens need to do to mature into competent adults, the picture becomes much clearer. Smartphone-based life, it turns out, alters or interferes with a great number of developmental processes."" Among them, he writes, kids spend less time playing with each other, less time taking physical risks (like climbing trees!), less time interacting face to face, less time learning from real-time conversational cues and less time learning how to resolve conflict (why do that when you can just block your antagonist?). He suggests that the psychological development of children born in and after 1996 has been ""fundamentally altered"" by the ubiquity of smartphones. ""Synchronous interactions make us feel closer to the other person because that's what getting 'in sync' does,"" he writes. ""Texts, posts, and many other virtual interactions lack synchrony. There is less real laughter, more room for misinterpretation, and more stress after a comment that gets no immediate response."" Add to that the insecurities inherent in an adolescent's budding sexuality, or the indescribably mean way middle-school girls can behave with one another, plus the availability of online porn and you have a social nightmare on your hands. ""My claim,"" writes Haidt, ""is that the new phone-based childhood that took shape roughly 12 years ago is making young people sick and blocking their progress to flourishing in adulthood. We need a dramatic cultural correction, and we need it now."" He proposes four simple correctives that wouldn't cost a penny: No smartphones before high school. No social media before 16. Phone-free schools. More independence, free play and responsibility in the real world. How I wish it were as easy as writing down such commonsense rules, or even passing a law. -- @robinkabcarian Graphic    PHOTO: A DYE in Cheetos linked to brain changes is among the targets of a California bill.

"March 18, 2024","Follow the money, and you'll find Donald Trump in deep trouble",96,"  Link to Image Back in 2000 when Donald Trump first tested the waters of a presidential campaign by giving a series of speeches as a possible Reform Party candidate, he famously told Forbes Magazine, ""It's very possible that I could be the first presidential candidate to run and make money on it."" He was speaking at the time about a weird deal he had going with motivational speaker Anthony Robbins in which he timed his political appearances around paid seminars that Robbins paid him a million bucks to give. By the time he decided to run for real in 2015, he didn't publicly suggest that he could make money campaigning but he did make the case that he was incorruptible saying, ""I don't need anybody's money."" (He'd obviously figured out that that real graft was to be made once he was in the White House.) He pledged to spend a hundred million of his own money on his run but contributed only about $66 million out of $398 million so Trump didn't ""self-fund"" by a long shot. In 2020 he didn't use any of his own money at all instead raising $774 million for the campaign with the RNC and his Super PACs raising much more. (The 2020 election was by far the most expensive in history, doubling the record-breaking 2016 campaign.) His spending in that campaignwas so profligate that it ended up having a cash crunch in the months before the election.  Still, the myth persists among the MAGA faithful that Trump is incorruptible because he's allegedly a self-made billionaire and doesn't need anyone's money. (And even though they believe this, they've been sending him their own hard-earned cash just because they love him so much.) Back in 2019, Politico reported on research showing that this myth has had some pretty serious political consequences: Using a 2017 University of Maryland Critical Issues Poll, we found that believing Trump was not born ""very wealthy"" leads to at least a 5-percentage-point boost in the president's job approval, even after considering the many factors that can influence public approval ratings. This shift is rooted in the belief that his humble roots make Trump both more empathetic (he ""feels my pain""), and more skilled at business (he is self-made and couldn't have climbed to such heights without real business know-how).  When voters were informed of the truth, that Trump was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and had to be bailed out repeatedly by his father, there were ""noticeable and statistically significant effects on evaluations of Trump's character,"" losing 10 percentage points from Republicans on empathy and 10 points on business acumen. ""Our research shows that the basic information plugged-in elites take for granted is not known by many Americans, and can be consequential in political evaluations,"" the researchers concluded. Imagine that. The following video has gone viral on social media the last couple of days and it shows what might have been if all journalists had been as aggressive as Barbara Walters was in 1990 when she confronted Trump with his recent business failure (just one of many more to come) and the lies he was telling the public: You'll notice that his persecution complex was in full effect even then, as he whines to Walters that nobody's ever been treated as unfairly as he has been.  Trump has been dancing as fast as he can for decades, trying to stay one step ahead of bankruptcy and the law and he has been successful at doing it, apparently leading him to truly believe that he could always prevail by sheer force of will. When the 2020 election didn't go his way, his fragile psyche couldn't take it and he simply created an alternate reality in order to cope. Now he's faced with the greatest challenge of his life, and he has to make one great hail mary pass in order to keep himself from going broke and out of prison. He has to win the presidency and he desperately needs money to pay his own legal expenses and finance his campaign. It's not going all that well.  The wheels of justice are grinding infuriatingly slowly, largely due to some judges (and Supreme Court justices) who seem to be happy to help Trump out of his immediate criminal jam. But the civil judgments against him add up to more than half a billion dollars and nobody knows exactly what kind of collateral he's having to put up to post the required bonds or who might be acting as his benefactor. The potential for corruption is so immense it's stunning that anyone could have the chutzpah to run for president under these circumstances. But then again, this is Trump we're talking about and the White House is his guaranteed get-out-of-jail-free card.  But what about his campaign? Considering his precarious personal financial situation there's no way that Trump will be self-funding any part of it and he's commandeered the RNC for his personal use, most likely to help him pay for any lawyers who won't allow him to stiff them. So, according to the New York Times, he's having to hustle like crazy for campaign donations: One of the most pressing issues facing Mr. Trump is the financial disparity he and allied groups now face with Mr. Biden and the Democratic Party. Mr. Biden's campaign announced on Sunday that it entered March with $155 million cash on hand with the party, after raising $53 million in February. The Trump operation has not released a more recent total, but his campaign account and the Republican National Committee had around $40 million at the end of January. Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course. He's having to hit up billionaires and Wall Street more than ever before and it sure looks like he's making some deals, such as his abrupt turnaround on banning TikTok last week after meeting with one of their major investors. This is because so far, his small donor base appears to finally be a little bit tapped out. The campaign claims that February will be its strongest month for small dollar fundraising which would beat the $22.3 million in August. But as the Times pointed out, the Biden campaign is seeing a massive rush of small donor money, raising more than $10 million online after the State of the Union, more than doubling Trump's much-ballyhooed haul of $4.2 million from his ignominious mug shot.  How can it be that Biden is raising so much more money when we are told daily that Trump voters are overwhelmingly excited while Biden's are disconsolate and depressed? Well, money isn't everything and incumbency always has an edge in the money game but it does seem odd that with Trump holding a slight lead in many of the polls he would be having trouble raising money while the Democrats are awash in cash.  Perhaps Biden voters are more enthused than is commonly recognized or, just as likely, are more terrified of another Trump term. But maybe it's also the case that Trump's rapturous followers aren't as representative of Republican voters as they would have us believe. And just maybe people have heard a few things about Trump being indicted on 91 felony counts in several different criminal cases and being hit with over half a billion dollars in fines. Is it possible that people are still telling pollsters they support Trump but they aren't putting their cash where their mouths are? I wouldn't be surprised. Sometimes money does speak louder than words.

"April 7, 2024","For Gen Z, it's see and be seen in this line for coffee; People-watching hits new heights at Community Goods",97,"  Come for the matcha latte, stay for a potential sighting of Justin and Hailey Bieber. Or is it the other way around? No matter the time or day, Community Goods, a petite coffee shop in Beverly Grove, draws the early-20s crowd for a line that stretches down the block. Since opening in February 2023, the cafe's cups with square logos have made an appearance in thousands of Instagram and TikTok posts. While overly posed photos of lattes feel reminiscent of a now-cringey, millennial Instagram, a flash of the Community Goods cup has become something of a Gen Z status symbol. For $6, it's more attainable than other photos taken only to be shared: a manicure in a luxury car, a peek of a designer shoe or a recognizable dish at an impossible-to-get-into restaurant. Yet it still implies (or at least attempts to imply) a leisurely, influencer-adjacent lifestyle. The line at Community Goods on this Sunday morning features a range of Los Angeles styles. Two friends match in designer sneakers, black leggings and Chrome Hearts hoodies (if authentic, $600-plus each). There is every version of Ugg boot and lip filler galore. The odd industrial goth breaks up neutral-toned athleisure. In a line this long, it'll take 40 minutes to get to the register and another 20 to get an order. There are lines for coffee elsewhere in Los Angeles, like at Los Feliz's Maru Coffee and Echo Park's Canyon Coffee, but Community Goods loyalists seem to be excited, not frustrated, by the waiting around. Standing in the sun off Melrose Avenue in a curated outfit is part of the day's plans. Online preorder is available, but no one here is in a rush. Many in the crowd swear they're not just there to see and be seen but for the quality product. The cafe is known for its iced matcha, vanilla lattes and breakfast sandwich sliders on King's Hawaiian rolls. The menu has a few funkier items, like an ice salted maple cappuccino and a Hojicha Spanner (cream top). Drinks range from $4 to $7, sliders start at $10 before adding bacon or avocado -- prices comparable to the competition. ""I think about the line as a group effort. We're all waiting and we all get a reward in the end with our coffee,"" says Shima Rable, 21, who is on vacation from Toronto. She and her friend Sasha Grub, 19, have stopped by Community Goods multiple times while visiting L.A., and this is Rable's second day in a row there. ""I found out about Community Goods through my queen Hailey [Bieber]. She's my fashion inspiration,"" says Rable. Even though the line was too long, the space was too small and her expectations went unmet, Grub says she'd still be back. Ibraheem Agaba, 26, is waiting for his date to arrive at Community Goods. He was skeptical at first after hearing about the cafe from a friend. The crowd leaned a bit ""basic"" for his liking. But after trying the food and drinks, he was hooked. ""So I guess I'll be basic all day long,"" he laughs. The line inspires him to be on his fashion A-game. ""People try to bring their best as far as style goes when they come here, and I appreciate that. That's not something I see a lot of in L.A. It's kind of dead. I think Community Goods is one of the only establishments that's holding that expectation up, and that's why I'm here this morning."" Julius Woods, 24, and Niki Zahedi, 25, are seated on the cramped back patio at a table overflowing with sliders, cookies and drinks. ""Community Goods is the new era of Soho House for young creatives. There's always that one spot in L.A. that's popping, and this is the current one,"" says Woods, who runs the music magazine Lucid Monday. When asked if he has ever networked or done any work at the cafe -- the alleged purpose of Soho House -- he clarifies that he prefers to people watch. ""There's so many cafes but this one really stood out to me because I love their logo. I'm a graphic designer and I really love their branding and overall aesthetic,"" says Sierra Lee, 24. She first heard about it because of the Biebers but also approves of the matcha. With no marketing or publicity budget, co-owner Pedro Cavaliere, 30, attributes the cafe's initial success to a decade of banked favors. ""I worked my entire life for very influential people and never asked for anything in return. They saw me literally building the cafe with my own hands during lockdown and were ready to support. ... I never expected it to become what it is,"" says the Brazilian immigrant, who once was a personal assistant for musician A-Trak and a tour DJ for Rihanna. Austin Quire, 20, and Andrew Tabak, 24, recognize the cafe feels like what transplants and TikTok users associate with Los Angeles. ""There's a lot of copy and paste. ... If you took a picture of this place, without context you would be able to tell it's in L.A.,"" says Quire, who, like other customers, is wearing a Chrome Hearts hoodie. Los Angeles' layout and car culture reduce spontaneous interaction and leave room for a coffee shop line to be a place for which you plan outfits. An 18-year-old fan and an A-lister enjoying the same latte creates the illusion of access to a version of Los Angeles reserved for the rich and famous. It's enticing enough that a year in, the line is as long as ever and a second location in West Hollywood is in the works. Paparazzi haven't caught Hailey Bieber at the cafe since November, but according to its 20-something fans, the matcha is still worth waiting for.

"March 26, 2024",Former Nickelodeon Star Allie DiMeco Says She Was Forced to Kiss an Adult Man on 'The Naked Brothers Band' Series,98,"  Following the premiere of Investigation Discovery's Quiet on Set, a docuseries that exposes the disturbing behind-the-scenes environments of various TV shows at Nickelodeon, The Naked Brothers Band alum Allie DiMeco has shared her own experience on the set of the show, which aired from 2007-09. In the musical mockumentary series starring Nat and Alex Wolff as fictionalized versions of themselves, DiMeco played the former's love interest, Rosalina. During the third season, DiMeco's character, who is a teenager, has a short-lived romance with a French man named Michel (played by Jake Hertzog). In a scene of the two-part episode ""Naked Idol,"" he kisses her in front of Nat, causing Rosalina's temporary exit from the band.  In a TikTok shared over the weekend, DiMeco spoke about the onscreen kiss after watching Quiet on Set. She said that she was ""stressed"" while watching the docuseries. Panning her camera to the docuseries paused on her computer screen, she said that, much like the other Nickelodeon stars who spoke for the series, she ""went through trauma."" @missalliedimeco TV talk brought to you by me and #mightypatch #iykyk #quietonset #mystory #nbb #nakedbeothersband #nickelodeon #PTSD #theick #absolutelymental #kidactor original sound - Allie DiMeco ""There was an episode where Rosalina 'cheated' on Nat and kind of kissed a French guy,"" she explained, adding that she ""did not"" want to kiss him.  ""He's a 30-year-old man. I'm sorry, I couldn't even watch it. It gives me fucking the ick and it honestly gives me PTSD,"" DiMeco said while playing an edited version of the Naked Brothers Band clip in question. ""I'm watching this Quiet on Set documentary and it's talking about how integral and vital it is to create - especially when it's a kids cast - to create an environment where kids feel comfortable to say 'No' or 'I don't feel comfortable with this.' And I'm like, 'Yeah, maybe they do express that though, it's also more important to create an environment that listens to the kids and actually does not make them do things when they don't want to do them,'"" she said. DiMeco continued, ""They made me kiss this 30 plus-year-old man when I was like, what, 14, 15? I told them many times that I didn't want to do it. My mom was very against it and they pretty much made me feel like I was going to lose my job, that I might be fired if I didn't do it."" DiMeco claimed the environment on set was one of ""highly nepotism-nepo kids"" where ""everybody knew each other on the cast, more or less, except for me."" The series was created and co-executive produced by showrunner Polly Draper, mother to starring brothers Nat and Alex. Their real father, Michael Wolff, played the onscreen dad and their cousin, Jesse Draper, played the group's babysitter. She says Kristina Reyes was also ""externally"" cast. In the comments, DiMeco noted that Hertzog ""wasn't even an actor. He was the backup guitarist for live shows and practiced with us in band practice and always wanted to be written in."" Back in November, DiMeco made a TikTok reflecting on another alarming situation on set while revealing why she left acting. @missalliedimeco The infamous "" why did you give up acting?"" A question that haunts me to this day. While I am so grateful and appreciative for the experiences that I had on TV as a kid, I learned from an early age that this is not the end all be all dream that I wanted to chase for my whole life. The business was not as shiny or fun as they made it seem to a kid. I was able to learn from an early age that I could be in control of my own life and what I chose to do with it...i just didnt know it in this situation, thank God for my mom who supports any decision I ever make. #tvtalk #behindthescenes #nickelodeon #childactor #losangeles #thenakedbrothersband #nakedbrothersband #rosalina #alliedimeco #firstkiss #onset #kidactor original sound - Allie DiMeco She explained that, because she had been so busy as a child actor, she had not had her first kiss before her first onscreen one for the show. When the show decided to have an episode centered around Nat and Rosalina's kiss in the first season, DiMeco, who at the time was ""12 or 13,"" ""freaked out"" because she hadn't experienced it in real life yet. Alongside her mother, the former child star told producers and the show's director that she was not going to have her first kiss be for the show.

"March 14, 2024",Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is assembling an investor group to buy TikTok,99,"  As Congress weighs a bill that would lead to a nationwide ban of the popular video app TikTok, former Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin said Thursday he is assembling an investor group that will try to purchase the China-based company. ""This should be owned by U.S. businesses,"" Mnuchin told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Thursday morning. ""There's no way that the Chinese would ever let a U.S. company own something like this in China."" Mnuchin said he had spoken to a ""bunch of people"" about forming a group. ""It would be a combination of investors, so there would be no one investor that controls this,"" he said. ""The issue is all about the technology. This needs to be controlled by U.S. businesses."" With concern growing among U.S. leaders about TikTok's influence - particularly on young people - the U.S. House passed a bipartisan bill Wednesday that would lead to a nationwide ban if owner ByteDance Ltd. does not sell its stake. President Biden has pledged to sign the bill, which passed in the House by a vote of 352-65, but its fate is uncertain in the Senate. Mnuchin, a Republican who served as Treasury secretary under former President Trump, said he thought the company should be sold. ""I think the legislation should pass, and I think it should be sold,"" he said. This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"April 1, 2024","Frankie Muniz Walked Off 'Malcolm in the Middle' Set for Two Episodes: ""Everyone Was So Afraid""",100,"  Frankie Muniz explained this week why his titular Malcolm in the Middle character was absent for two episodes of the show: The actor walked off the set.  ""There were two episodes I'm not in. I walked off the set,"" Muniz said during an appearance on Australia's I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here, shared by News.com.au.  ""Everyone was so afraid to stand up when certain people were controlling or rude or disrespectful,"" he continued. ""They walked on pins and needles.""  Muniz clarified that it wasn't necessarily him specifically experiencing the tension, but that he was ""so mortified by seeing people afraid to stand up for themselves"" that ""it was worth it to me.""  ""I didn't care if they told me I was never going back,"" he added, also ceding that he was able to make such a move given his status as the series protagonist.  Muniz starred in Malcolm in the Middle for its seven-season run from 2000 to 2006, when he was a teenager. Since then, he has mostly left acting in pursuit of a NASCAR career, but recently reflected on his experience as a child actor on TikTok.  ""I would never let my kid go into the business,"" Muniz said. ""And not that I had a negative experience, because to be honest, my experience was 100 percent positive. But I know so many people, friends that were close to me, that had such insanely negative experiences."" Muniz and wife Paige Price, whose son Mauz is 3, both are familiar with the television and media business. ""I just think it's an ugly world in general,"" he added. ""I never cared about rejection, but there's a ton of rejection."" Nevertheless, Muniz still holds fondness for his Malcolm family. In 2022, he said he would love to revisit the show.  ""I know Bryan Cranston is really into the idea,"" he said at the time. ""There might be something. I would be down 100 percent.""

"March 11, 2024",Gen Z's weekend plans? Wait an hour for a $6 matcha in your most expensive hoodie,101,"  Come for the matcha latte, stay for a potential sighting of Justin and Hailey Bieber. Or is it the other way around? No matter the time or day, Community Goods, a petite coffee shop in Beverly Grove, draws the early-20s crowd for a line that stretches down the block. Since opening last February, the cafe's cups with square logos have made an appearance in thousands of Instagram and TikTok posts. While overly posed photos of lattes feel reminiscent of a now cringey, millennial Instagram, a flash of the Community Goods cup has become somewhat of a Gen Z status symbol. For $6, it's more attainable than other photos taken only to be shared: a manicure in a luxury car, a peek of a designer shoe or a recognizable dish at an impossible-to-get-into restaurant. Yet it still implies (or at least attempts to imply) a leisurely, influencer-adjacent lifestyle. The line at Community Goods on this Sunday morning features a range of Los Angeles styles. Two friends match in designer sneakers, black leggings and Chrome Hearts hoodies (if authentic, over $600 each). There is every version of Ugg boot and lip filler galore. The odd industrial goth breaks up neutral-toned athleisure. In a line this long, it'll take 40 minutes to get to the register and another 20 to get an order. There are lines for coffee elsewhere in Los Angeles like at Los Feliz's Maru Coffee and Echo Park's Canyon Coffee, but Community Goods loyalists seem to be excited, not frustrated, by the waiting around. Standing in the sun off Melrose Avenue in a curated outfit is part of the day's plans. Online pre-order is available, but no one here is in a rush. Many in the crowd swear they're not just there to see and be seen, but for the quality product. The cafe is known for its iced matcha, vanilla lattes and breakfast sandwich sliders on King Hawaiian rolls. The menu has a few funkier items like an ice salted maple cappuccino and Hojicha Spänner (cream top). Drinks range from $4 to $7, sliders start at $10 before adding bacon or avocado - prices comparable to the competition. ""I think about the line as a group effort. We're all waiting and we all get a reward in the end with our coffee,"" says Shima Rable, 21, who is on vacation from Toronto. She and her friend Sasha Grub, 19, have stopped by Community Goods multiple times while visiting L.A. and this is Rable's second day there in a row. ""I found out about Community Goods through my queen Hailey [Bieber]. She's my fashion inspiration,"" says Rable. Even though the line was too long, the space was too small and her expectations went unmet, Grub says she'd still be back. Ibraheem Agaba, 26, is waiting for his date to arrive at Community Goods. He was skeptical at first after hearing about the cafe from a friend. The crowd leaned a bit ""basic"" for his liking. But after trying the food and drinks, he was hooked. ""So I guess I'll be basic all day long,"" he laughs. The line inspires him to be on his fashion A-game. ""People try to bring their best as far as style goes when they come here and I appreciate that. That's not something I see a lot of in L.A. It's kind of dead. I think Community Goods is one of the only establishments that's holding that expectation up and that's why I'm here this morning."" Julius Woods, 24, and Niki Zahedi, 25, are seated on the cramped back patio at a table overflowing with sliders, cookies and drinks. ""Community Goods is the new era of Soho House for young creatives. There's always that one spot in L.A. that's popping and this is the current one,"" says Woods, who runs the music magazine Lucid Monday. When asked if he has ever networked or done any work at the cafe - the alleged purpose of Soho House - he clarifies that he prefers to people watch. ""There's so many cafes but this one really stood out to me because I love their logo. I'm a graphic designer and I really love their branding and overall aesthetic,"" says Sierra Lee, 24. She first heard about it because of the Biebers but also approves of the matcha. With no marketing or publicity budget, co-owner Pedro Cavaliere, 30, attributes the cafe's initial success to a decade of banked favors. ""I worked my entire life for very influential people and never asked for anything in return. They saw me literally building the cafe with my own hands during lockdown and were ready to support ... I never expected it to become what it is,"" says the Brazilian immigrant who once was a personal assistant for musician A-Trak and tour DJ for Rihanna. Austin Quire, 20, and Andrew Tabak, 24, recognize the cafe feels like what transplants and TikTok users associate with Los Angeles. ""There's a lot of copy and paste ... if you took a picture of this place, without context you would be able to tell it's in L.A.,"" says Quire, who like other customers, is wearing a Chrome Hearts hoodie. Los Angeles' layout and car culture reduce spontaneous interaction and leave room for a coffee shop line to be a place for which you plan outfits. An 18-year-old fan and an A-lister enjoying the same latte creates the illusion of access to a version of Los Angeles reserved for the rich and famous. It's enticing enough that a year in, the line is as long as ever and a second location in West Hollywood is in the works. Paparazzi haven't caught Hailey Bieber at the cafe since November, but according to its 20-something fans, the matcha is still worth waiting for. This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"March 7, 2024",Ghosting is ruthless. So why are we all doing it?,103,"  Alexis Fischer was excited to jump back into the dating world after being single for two years.  The professional dancer-turned-entrepreneur took time to heal from her breakup with her ex-boyfriend of nearly four years. She also wanted to focus on building her business, the Move by Lexfish app, where she teaches virtual Pilates, dance and other fitness classes. Then, in May, she was accepted on Raya, an exclusive, membership-based app that initially focused on dating but has expanded into a digital spot to build friendships and business relationships. Fischer started messaging two men and eventually went on multiple dates with each of them. She kept in touch with them via text and FaceTime, and things were seemingly going well, until all of a sudden: crickets. ""I've been ghosted twice in the past month,"" a teary-eyed Fischer said in a video on TikTok, where she has more than 28,000 followers.  In dating, ghosting is when someone ends all communication without giving the other person any warning or explanation. In the video, Fischer went on to talk about how the experience bruised her ego and left her feeling rejected. Dozens of people commented, saying that they had had similar experiences.  ""It was just absurd to me,"" said Fischer, 30, of the South Bay, told The Times. ""You start to question yourself, like 'Did I say something? Did I do something?' And you read back all your texts and just kind of go crazy."" It wasn't as if she thought either of these men were ""the love of her life,"" she said, but she would have preferred for them to let her know that they didn't want to date her anymore rather than disappearing and causing ""emotional turmoil"" for her. ""We need to all collectively be better,"" she said in a follow-up TikTok video. ""We don't need to ghost. We are better than that. Send a clear text, a voice note, call them ... Just be clear.""  With the rise of online dating and social media, ghosting has become a common experience for many people. A 2023 Forbes survey, which polled 5,000 U.S. residents who'd actively been on dates within the last five years, found that 60% of respondents said they had been ghosted before.  Meanwhile, 45% said they have ghosted another person. Findings also show that men and women are equally to blame: Forty-four percent of men and 47% of women said they'd ghosted someone before. (This study didn't appear to be inclusive of all gender identities.)  Ebony Utley, a professor of communication studies at Cal State Long Beach, said ghosting has likely been around forever. However, because there are now so many ways to reach someone whether it's via phone, email or lurking on their social media, ghosting has become more intentional. L.A.-based marriage and family therapist Ali Cortes said the COVID-19 pandemic has played a role in people communicating less with others.  ""It's a trend that is acceptable,"" Cortes said, adding that no one likes to be on the receiving end of it.  Many experts agree that ghosting is generally frowned upon with the exception being if you feel unsafe around someone or if any red flags such as lying or abusive behavior pops up.  Letting someone know that you're no longer interested in them can feel nerve-wracking. (We all get it.) But getting ghosted feels way worse. Here's what experts say you should do instead.  What actually happens when people ghostothers There are several reasons why people ghost. Some do it because they're afraid of confrontation. Others think they are sparing the other person's feelings, while some simply don't think they owe the other person an explanation.  ""People lie for two reasons,"" said Utley, author of the 2019 book ""He Cheated, She Cheated, We Cheated: Women Speak About Infidelity."" ""They lie to protect themselves, and they lie to protect other people. So ghosting lets people do both at the same time."" A ghoster may think, ""'I protect myself from being a bad person,'"" Utley said, ""'and I protect you from hating me by not explaining the real reason why I don't want to know you anymore.'""  No matter which way you slice it, suddenly disappearing without letting the other person know can cause more harm than good. Although research hasn't fully explained the psychological effects of ghosting, a 2020 study published by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health related its effects to ""ostracism,"" which could cause feelings of ""loneliness, depressed mood, frustration, anxiety and helplessness."" ""It is disrespectful,"" said Cortes, who's also the founder of Bienestar Counseling, Coaching and Consulting. ""Because there's no feedback, it leaves the person out in the cold.""  Utley said that when people are ghosted, they often revert to their ""little kid state"" where they think that everything is their fault. Questions including ""Is it something that I did? Did I make them mad? Was I not good enough?"" might circle their minds.  ""It usually interferes with our self-esteem in some way,"" she said. ""And if that happens to you recurringly in patterns, then you really start to think, 'Oh, snap. It's me. People just don't want to be in communication with me.' And it might just be you've run into a bunch of a-holes."" But if the person doing the ghosting were candid, then you'd know whether the issue is you (for example, they said you came on too strong), and as a result, you could decide whether you want to work on those personality traits.  What should you do instead?  Ghosting is easy - that's why people do it. But if you're willing to do the alternative, here are a couple options for what you could say. If you've lost interest in the person you are dating and no longer want to communicate with them, Cortes recommends using the sandwich method, in which you deliver negative or constructive feedback between two slices of positive comments.  You can start by thanking the person for sharing their time with you and let them know that you've enjoyed getting to know them, Cortes said. Then insert your reason. Some examples are ""I've realized that I'm not ready for a relationship right now,"" ""Our values don't align"" or ""We don't want the same thing."" Wrap up by saying something such as this: ""I want to respectfully let you know so that you can move on, and I can move on as well,"" and then tell them to take care.  Another option, says Mike Chang, a marriage and family therapist based in Glendale, is ""making it more about you"" and less about the other person. It's fine to keep your explanation for ending the relationship brief.  ""I think people have preferences when it comes to what kind of person they want to be in a relationship with, which is totally fine,"" Chang said. ""But nobody wants to be told that they don't have something or a trait that [you're] looking for."" A key reminder: If your comment isn't constructive, keep it to yourself.  Let's be friends It may be tempting to end this tough conversation by saying ""We can be friends"" as a way to cushion the blow. But experts warn that you shouldn't say this or agree to it unless that's what you actually want. Doing so can sometimes make the other person think they still have a chance with you romantically. It can also leave the door open for them to cross your boundaries.  Instead, Utley recommends saying something like this: ""I've enjoyed getting to know you, but I don't want us to be in communication anymore.""  ""Yes, it is a very difficult thing to say,"" Utley said. ""And, yes, it's a very difficult thing to hear. But if you don't want to be in communication anymore, you're going to get that. That person is not going to keep reaching out to you, and if they do, you might have to get the police involved. But at least you've been clear."" Should you have this conversation in person?  When asked whether you should have this conversation in person, via text or over the phone, Utley advised picking whichever one makes you feel most comfortable. Any of these options is ""better than nothing,"" she said, ""because sometimes those in-person conversations end up being conversations when you really just want to end a relationship."" If you think an in-person conversation might go sideways or put you in a dangerous situation, then a phone call or text might be best, Utley said.  Ultimately, no matter what's said, there's still a chance that the conversation may not be well received.  ""I think how the other person responds is a variable that we can't control,"" said Chang, who's also the program director for Lighthouse Counseling Solutions. They might be mature about it or they might have a complete meltdown. However, it's not your responsibility to make the other person ""feel better about the breakup because they are going to interpret it however they want to interpret it,"" he said.  Your only job - and the only thing you can control - is being transparent, clear and respectful about your desire to end communication.  The long-term benefit There could be another positive outcome from having this conversation. Utley said learning how to communicate effectively can help you become a better friend, parent, sibling, neighbor, employer, colleague and employee. ""This kind of practice is going to help you if you ever have to deliver bad news to anyone, anywhere, at any time,"" she said. ""Practicing these things now will help you do that and make all those forthcoming situations in your life a little bit easier.""  Cortes likes to think of this skill as an act of kindness toward yourself and the other person. ""If I do this one hard thing of rejecting [someone], I'm actually helping both of us have a healthier dynamic with other people,"" she said. By saying no to this person, you are ultimately saying yes to yourself and freeing the other person to do the same. A new dating standard A few months after Fischer's back-to-back ghosting experiences, she started messaging another guy she had met on Instagram. They FaceTimed several times, but she eventually realized that they were on different paths in their lives and ultimately weren't compatible. So she decided to break it off with him.  He responded with ""a nice, long message,"" she said, acknowledging that he couldn't give her what she was looking for at the time and that he respected her decision. Then they went their separate ways.  ""I was a little sick to my stomach about it, and then once we had the conversation, I was like, 'Oh, my gosh. I feel so light. I feel clear,'"" she said. ""Let's have that conversation always.""  The experience has given Fischer a new perspective and confidence about dating. It's also taught her that being ghosted is ""not a reflection of me at all because I know I'm a catch,"" she said. ""I know what I have to offer.""

"March 1, 2024",Granderson: Past victories to protect queer kids at school didn't save Nex Benedict,106,"  The name Pat Logue may not be familiar to many of us, but her work is. From establishing the right of same-sex parents to adopt children to challenging the merits of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, it's not an exaggeration to say Logue's accomplishments as a lawyer for Lambda Legal were instrumental in changing the way society treats LGBTQ+ people. She died last week. It is because of Logue's work that the family of Nex Benedict may get some iota of justice. Nex was the nonbinary 16-year-old in Oklahoma who died in February one day after a group of students beat them up in a school restroom. One of Logue's landmark victories - Nabozny vs. Podlesny in 1996 - was the first legal challenge to antigay violence in public schools. Jamie Nabozny had been tormented for years at his Wisconsin high school for being gay. That would include being beaten up in the restroom. He sued his former district for refusing to do anything to stop the attacks. Officials were not only aware of the abuse Nabozny faced but also reportedly told him that ""boys will be boys"" and that he should expect the bullying because he was gay. After the verdict, Nabozny was awarded $1 million. More important, school districts around the country were put on notice: Every student - regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity - deserves a safe learning environment. Nex Benedict did not get that. Instead, the student faced an environment very similar to the one Nabozny encountered 25 years earlier. An environment our courts have already ruled was unacceptable. An environment that may have cost Nex their life. Police body-cam video shows Nex on a gurney after the attack in school. The details of their death the following day are murky, and an official cause of death has yet to be made public. But the history of abuse leading up to the death is clear. Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) has already called for a federal investigation into Nex's death. Vice President Kamala Harris posted on social media: ""to the LGBTQI+ youth who are hurting and are afraid right now: President Joe Biden and I see you, we stand with you, and you are not alone."" This week Lambda Legal joined 350 other local, state and national organizations in an open letter calling for the removal of Oklahoma's state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters. In the letter, Walters is accused of creating an environment in Oklahoma schools hostile to LGBTQ students, which the organizations say led to the attack on Nex. ""In the weeks following Nex's death, numerous youths have come forward to detail the rampant harassment of Oklahoma's 2SLGBTQI+ students by peers, teachers, and administrators,"" the letter reads, using an abbreviation that includes the Indigenous term ""two spirit"" to refer to some nonbinary individuals. ""We are outraged that a climate of hate and bigotry has been not only allowed to thrive, but encouraged by the person who is responsible for education in the state."" In addition to Walters' anti-trans rhetoric, he appointed a conservative social media influencer to the state's library board after that person harrassed educators online who were supportive of LGBTQ+ students. Walters dismissed the open letter as a ""standard tactic of the radical left"" adding, ""they will stop at nothing to destroy the country and our state."" And yet it was Walters - not the ""radical left"" - who appointed an anti-LGBTQ TikTok pseudo-celebrity to his state's library board, someone who didn't even live in Oklahoma and whose anti-gay social media posts incited bomb threats against school libraries accused of containing books that refer to gay people. Walters should never have been entrusted with overseeing the education and safety of children, and now that the mistake has been made and the damage done, I hope he will be swiftly removed and replaced by someone with an agenda to protect the learning environment. Whether or not the state replaces him, a civil suit against the district where Nex attended school, in the Tulsa suburb of Owasso, seems likely. There's also the question of holding those who attacked Nex accountable. In a statement to ABC News, the victim's family said: ""The Benedicts know all too well the devastating effects of bullying and school violence, and pray for meaningful change wherein bullying is taken seriously and no family has to deal with another preventable tragedy."" That's why Nabozny said he sued his school district in the 1990s: to prevent other queer kids from being targeted in school the way he was. That is also supposed to be a part of local and state administrators' jobs. In the past, gross failures to protect queer children might have been normal and tolerated. Certainly they had few repercussions. Thanks to Logue, that part of the story has changed. Queer kids are still targeted in school. However, instead of accepting the premise of ""boys will be boys,"" there's hope for accountability. @LZGranderson This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"February 26, 2024",Gunman who killed 2 in Corona movie theater sentenced to life in prison without parole,107,"  A man, who shot and killed a TikTok star and an 18-year-old college student at a Corona movie theater three years ago, was sentenced Monday to life in prison without possibility of parole.  Joseph Jimenez Jr., 23, was sentenced in a Riverside courtroom. He was convicted during a December trial of two counts of first-degree murder, as well as a sentencing enhancement of personal use of a firearm causing death.  On July 26, 2021, Jimenez shot 19-year-old TikTok star Anthony Barajas and college sophomore Rylee Goodrich, both of Corona, during a showing of the film ""The Forever Purge"" at the Regal Edwards Corona Crossings theater, according to authorities. Six people were in the audience for the 9:35 p.m. showing; Barajas and Goodrich were on their first date.  In what authorities described as an ""unprovoked attack,"" Jimenez went to his car and got a bag containing a gun. He sneaked up behind the victims as the credits rolled and opened fire. Investigators said there was no indication Jimenez knew the victims or had any interaction with them before the shooting.  Barajas was shot ""execution-style"" and Goodrich was also shot point-blank in the head, authorities said. Goodrich died at the scene, and Barajas died days later at a hospital after being taken off life support.  Jimenez was arrested the day after the shooting after his friends told police he left the theater halfway through the movie and returned with a bag holding a ""strap,"" according to a search warrant. Investigators found a gun that matched the weapon used in the shooting, as well as additional evidence at Jimenez's house.  Jimenez initially pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and said during his insanity trial that he was not taking his schizophrenia medication the day of the killings and heard voices in his head from ""Abigail"" and another person saying that the victims were dangerous.  In a jailhouse interview with the Riverside Press-Enterprise, Jimenez said that he had been recently diagnosed with schizophrenia but that he had stopped taking his medication because he ran out of pills. Jimenez told the newspaper that the only way he could save himself from the victims was to shoot them.  Jimenez was ruled sane by Superior Court Judge Timothy J. Hollenhorst in December.  During the trial, Hollenhorst said his decision to find Jimenez sane was influenced by the fact that he stole Goodrich's wallet after the shooting and had a ""normal interaction"" with a female concession worker before the movie, in which he asked her for her phone number. Hollenhorst also pointed out that Jimenez warned his friends about the shooting, ran out of an emergency exit door afterward and didn't immediately tell Corona police about the voices.  ""There is no question that the defendant suffers from schizophrenia. ... It is also clear to this court that the defendant was not treating his mental health issues appropriately by not regularly taking his medication,"" Hollenhorst said at the time.  Barajas was known on TikTok as itsanthonymichael and had nearly a million followers on the social media platform. He had attended Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana.  Goodrich was a sophomore at Grand Canyon University. Her family said she and Barajas went to the theater on a first date after Barajas had just returned from a trip to Hawaii.

"April 3, 2024",He faces execution. His lawyers may have earned less than $4 an hour,109,"  Brian Dorsey's argument for why he should not be executed by the state of Missouri requires the kind of math familiar to any gig worker. After Dorsey confessed to killing his cousins Sarah and Ben Bonnie with a shotgun in 2006, Missouri paid two lawyers $12,000 each to defend him. If they had worked 3,557 hours - the average time spent by defense lawyers in death penalty cases, according to a 2010 report commissioned by the federal courts - they would have each earned $3.37 per hour. Dorsey is scheduled to be put to death on April 9, and a growing number of scholars, lawyers and activists are asking federal courts, along with Missouri Gov. Mike Parson, to stop the execution. They argue that regardless of how much these lawyers worked, the way they were paid created a perverse incentive: Work less to earn more per hour. Paying lawyers a flat fee is a common practice across the legal system, from drunken driving to divorce cases, and it has been a way for cash-strapped courts and public defenders to keep their costs under control. But it has attracted more criticism when a life is at stake.  Though many states have turned away from flat fees in death penalty trials, including Texas and Missouri, a Marshall Project and Los Angeles Times review of court filings and media reports found they paved the way to death row for at least 20 people in the last four decades. That figure does not begin to capture the scale of the issue, because some of the largest counties in California, including Los Angeles County, paid flat fees in death cases for decades. ""Death sentences imposed under these systems often say more about the external funding limitations placed on counsel, and less about the nature of the crime or the culpability of the defendant,"" said Emily Olson-Gault, director of the American Bar Assn.'s Death Penalty Representation Project. Dorsey is one of at least three people on Missouri's death row - out of 13 - whose lawyers were paid a set fee, according to the Missouri State Public Defender, a state agency. So is David Hosier, who is scheduled to be executed on June 11. It's impossible to tally the national scope of the problem, legal experts say, because courts don't usually track such pay arrangements. But using legal databases, the Marshall Project found death penalty cases in more than a dozen states - including California, Florida, Indiana and Arizona - that involved flat fees as far back as the 1980s, with pay ranging from $800 to $180,000. Willie Pye was the most recent person executed in the United States, on March 20 in Georgia. His lawyer was paid a lump sum of $345,000 to represent every single felony defendant in rural Spalding County in 1996, the year Pye was sentenced to death, according to his clemency petition. Michael Aed, who represents Ger Lee for his role in the murders of four people in California's Fresno County, told KFSN-TV that getting paid a flat fee would be ""basically suicide for my business."" After the ACLU of Northern California sent a letter of protest, the county agreed to pay him hourly but didn't change its system for the future. Fresno County officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles County, records show a flat-fee structure is still on the books for capital cases - and the rate has not increased for at least three decades. To the south in Orange County, lawyers say they've been asked to compete by bidding to get paid as little as possible. (A court spokesman in Orange County said there are relatively few death penalty cases there, and lawyers' fees are determined on a case-by-case basis.) ""An attorney that isn't going to put in any work or minimal work will probably be making $200 an hour,"" said Southern California defense attorney John Aquilina. ""Somebody that's going to put in thousands of hours may generate a dollar an hour. And there's really no supervision. There's no restriction. There's nobody who's telling you you're putting in too many hours or you're not putting in enough hours."" Low flat rates have also driven experienced lawyers away from taking court appointments to work on death cases. After a particularly time-consuming case that ended this year in Riverside County, Aquilina - who's been a lawyer since 1981 - finally decided that he couldn't take any more death penalty cases in counties that pay flat rates. ""It's gonna be a cold, dark day before I take another one,"" he said. A spokeswoman for Riverside County said in an emailed statement that officials there have had ""a number of meetings with capital defense attorneys and we understand their concerns."" But she broadly defended the use of flat fees, saying the system is ""used widely"" throughout the state and that the $70,000 to $130,000 rate per case is ""comparable to our surrounding counties."" Courts across the country have been paying flat fees since at least the 1970s, when the U.S. Supreme Court briefly abolished and then revived the death penalty. The Missouri State Public Defender began paying some lawyers this way in the 1980s, according to Sean O'Brien, a longtime defense attorney who teaches law at University of Missouri-Kansas City. It kept costs for the state under control amid a wider crisis in public defense funding. For the lawyers paid a flat fee, ""It can be a boost to your cash flow at the beginning, but it's a drain on your cash flow if you actually do the work,"" O'Brien said. Flat fees have been slowly falling out of favor ever since. In 2003, the American Bar Assn. said flat fees would ""discourage lawyers from doing more than what is minimally necessary."" And in 2013, the Kansas Supreme Court struck down a death sentence in which the defendant's lawyer was paid such a fee. With a flat fee, lawyers don't need to track their work. In the Dorsey case, ""I don't know if these trial lawyers made minimum wage or $5,000 an hour, and you can't know,"" O'Brien said. The director of the Missouri State Public Defender, Mary Fox, wrote in a letter to the governor that her office stopped using flat fees after Dorsey's trial, recognizing that they remove the incentive to do an effective job. In recent years, Dorsey's current lawyers say they have made discoveries about his past that his original lawyers might have brought to the jury if they'd sought money for investigators. According to their interviews with people from his past, Dorsey was a successful football player in high school, raising the question of whether head injuries might have played a role in his erratic behavior, as they have for many prominent athletes. He began using crack cocaine in high school, possibly as a way to treat his undiagnosed depression, and he attempted suicide twice. Doctors who examined his case recently wrote he was likely experiencing psychosis during the murders, undermining his first-degree murder charge, which requires intent in Missouri. Prosecutors argued that Dorsey sexually assaulted Sarah Bonnie after killing her and poured bleach on her body. Because he pleaded guilty, these claims were not fully tested in court. (Dorsey has no memories of the crime, but his lawyers note he was never charged with rape, and only one police officer said he smelled bleach.) In media reports and court records, the Bonnies' family members appear to be split on whether Dorsey should be put to death. The lawyers who received $12,000 each, Scott McBride and Chris Slusher, declined to comment for this article. During a 2011 hearing over Dorsey's appeal, they acknowledged they could have asked for more money for a fuller investigation but said that dwelling on his possible psychosis and other mitigating factors might have undercut their overall strategy: Accept blame, express remorse and seek mercy. That strategy, they added at the hearing, was why they encouraged him to plead guilty in the first place. But this also happened to save them hundreds of hours of work. Dorsey's current lawyer, Megan Crane, points out that they failed to use a tactic required by ethical standards: demand that prosecutors drop the death penalty in exchange for a guilty plea. The Missouri Supreme Court and state attorney general have pushed back at his appeal and argue Dorsey has failed to find enough evidence that the flat-fee arrangement adversely affected his lawyers' choices. ""Attorneys are not exempt from the desire to balance working to earn money and having enough free time to enjoy their life outside of work,"" Assistant Atty. Gen. Terrence Messonnier wrote in a 2016 court filing, adding that an hourly rate might encourage lawyers to be less efficient and pad the bill. There's not much research comparing payment arrangements, but a 2012 Yale Law Journal study found that, in Philadelphia, public defenders who are paid a salary ""reduce their clients' murder conviction rate by 19% and lower the probability that their clients receive a life sentence by 62%"" compared with private lawyers paid flat fees. And when the ACLU pushed to end the flat-fee system in Los Angeles County in the mid-2000s, it was because civil rights attorneys had started to notice a stark difference in the outcomes. ""All the cases that were going to trial and ending in death were handled by private, appointed counsel - and they were paid by this flat-fee contract,"" said Natasha Minsker, a lawyer and consultant who was overseeing the organization's death penalty work at the time. Last week, Los Angeles County officials said they are ""currently analyzing the issue"" and ""open to considering potential changes, including transitioning to an hourly rate to better align with the federal courts."" In the meantime, the county pointed out that lawyers can petition the courts for additional money. Dorsey's scheduled execution comes at a moment of flux for Missouri, which was an epicenter of executions a decade ago and now has dueling efforts in its state Legislature to expand the death penalty andabolish it. (Both are led by Republicans.) Dorsey is also joining a wave of federal lawsuits around religious rights in the execution chamber. Missouri prison officials may set IV lines for lethal injection by making incisions - a procedure known as a ""cut-down"" - without pain medication, which Dorsey argues in court filings will interfere with his ability to speak with his spiritual advisor. Dorsey's lawyers argue that his death will be especially traumatic for corrections officers who spend their days with him. More than 70 of them have called for the governor to spare his life. They even allow him, as the prison barber, to use scissors to cut their hair. ""They all attest to Brian's rehabilitation, remorse, and ultimately, his redemption,"" said Crane, his lawyer. ""He says he wants to find a way to make people's lives better to atone for what he's done."" She noted that Dorsey's original lawyers could have visited him more often, getting to see his remorse so they could fully convey it to the jury. But under the flat-fee arrangement, visiting him would have cost them money.

In the past few years, Madison has opened up about the prevalence of disordered eating in the Playboy household. She spoke about her own experience with body dysmorphia in a 2021 TikTok video, and during a 2023 appearance on the Call Her Daddy podcast, Madison elaborated further on the ""rampant"" eating disorders battled by Playboy models living in Hugh Hefner's infamous mojo dojo casa house.  ""There was a lot of bulimia at the mansion, to the point where people would end up in the hospital sometimes,"" Madison told podcast host Alex Cooper. The Down the Rabbit Hole author said that household endemic was so severe that ""bathroom pipes had to be replaced.""  Kendra Wilkinson, Bridget Marquardt, Hugh Hefner, and Holly Madison. Photo by Laurence Cottrell/FilmMagic. Those memories are impacting Madison more than ever the older her children get. To help Rainbow and Forest avoid body dysmorphia and disordered eating, the mom of two told Us, ""We're really focused on healthy eating. I'm really careful not to say anything about dieting or weight or anything in front of my kids."" She added, ""If they're trying to shove something unhealthy in front of me, I just say, 'Oh, I'm doing a health thing.'"" Because of her experiences with Playboy, in addition to some difficult moments from her childhood, Madison emphasized that she's ""really focused"" on ensuring her daughter ""values the things she enjoys and that she's passionate about."" TV personality Kendra Wilkinson and ex-NFL player Hank Baskett's children, Hank IV and Alijah, are showing a love for the spotlight https://t.co/mdzTC8MgOD - SheKnows (@SheKnows) March 12, 2024 ""We don't want her to get into the mode where she's really focused on the way she looks, or trying to get attention for the way she looks or validation through that,"" the Girls Gone Wild alum explained. She continued, ""I think we've been really successful so far. She's on a better track than I was at that age for sure. I was already trying to look some sort of way when I was 11."" Madison dated Hefner from 2001 to 2008, and though they tried IVF, they never had children. The former model reflects on the failed fertility treatments with gratitude - in 2022, Madison told Entertainment Tonight, ""Looking back I'm so glad it didn't work 'cause I went on to have the kids of my dreams."" Two years after her split from the Playboy patriarch, Madison began dating Pasquale Rotella, whom she married in October 2013 just months after welcoming Rainbow that March.

"March 8, 2024",House Committee Unanimously Advances Bill That Could Make TikTok Unavailable in U.S.,112,"  A bill that could render TikTok banned from new downloads in the United States quickly advanced to the house on Thursday afternoon after a bipartisan committee voted 50-0 for its approval.  The bill, the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, was introduced earlier this month by representatives Mike Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi. If enacted, the legislation would block apps owned by TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, from being available in Apple or Google app stores in the U.S.  More specifically, the bill would prohibit apps owned by the Beijing-based company to be downloaded in the United States unless ByteDance divested its applications, including TikTok, within 180 days of the legislation's enactment. On a broader level, the bill would also allow the White House to - in certain cases - ban access to an app owned by a foreign adversary if the application threatened national security.  TikTok responded to the bill with a statement released shortly after its passing which read, ""The government is attempting to strip 170 million Americans of their Constitutional right to free expression. This will damage millions of businesses, deny artists an audience, and destroy the livelihoods of countless creators across the country."" The ACLU also released a statement slamming the proposed bill, writing that ""our elected officials are once again trying to trade our First Amendment rights for cheap political points.""  The statement continued, ""Whether it's watching cooking tutorials, discussing the news of the day, or livestreaming protests, we have a right to use TikTok and other platforms to exchange our thoughts, ideas, and opinions with people around the world.""  TikTok, the massively popular video-sharing platform, has proved quite influential in Hollywood. HBO CEO Casey Bloys recently told The Hollywood Reporter, ""There's an entire ecosystem of people who write about television, and want to talk about it, and get on social media and criticize it or praise it, or whatever. The effect of all of it together is to keep the show in the cultural conversation.""  Recent examples of the phenomenon's successes include last summer's Barbenheimer trend, which saw massive box office success spurred in part by social media trends, and December's Anyone But You, which proved a critical failure but was a beloved success on TikTok.

"February 27, 2024",How the 'Mob Wife' aesthetic can help us think about Latinidad,113,"  A new trend has emerged on TikTok and Instagram as users have abandoned the minimalist ""clean girl"" aesthetic and are opting for the bold luxury of animal prints, statement-making gold jewelry, long acrylic nails and faux furs to achieve the ""Mob Wife"" aesthetic. Influencers are citing Carmela and Adriana from ""The Sopranos"" (played by Edie Falco and Drea de Matteo, respectively) along with women from the films ""The Godfather"" and ""Scarface,"" and VH1 reality series ""Mob Wives"" (R.I.P. Big Ang) as the blueprints for this look. For Latines, this aesthetic might be recognizable from the American mob movies we watched growing up and also from the women in our families and communities, if not ourselves. It's not a coincidence that there are resonances between Latine and Italian American aesthetics. Both groups immigrated to the U.S. and faced discrimination. Latines and Italians often still face racial discrimination, which impacts how people live, work, and are policed. Both groups have also been stereotypically assumed to have connections to organized crime, which the ""Mob Wife"" aesthetic makes direct reference to. The excess that makes the ""Mob Wife"" aesthetic glamorous is what has also been leveraged against Latinas who wear similar styles to call them gaudy, overly sexual, classless, and cheap. ""If we think about the notion of femininity, it's rooted in Victorian ideas of propriety, piety and domesticity,"" explains Stacy Macías, professor of Women's Gender and Sexuality Studies at Cal State Long Beach. ""Those who have not had access to femininity are those who are working outside the home. The domain of femininity is the domain of whiteness.""  If fashion is the pieces of clothing that we wear, then style is how we wear those pieces together. While personal style is a reflection of one's individual preferences, it's refined by a larger web of relationships, experiences, and circumstances. The pieces that make up the ""Mob Wife"" aesthetic - the bold clothes, flashy jewelry, glossy nails and heavy makeup - all gesture to luxury and decadence.  But in the context of political struggle, limited financial means and social ostracization, these items hold a deeper significance. ""Style has always signified a sense of ownership and empowerment over our body,"" Macías said. ""It's one of the few ways that we can be self-determining in the way that we walk through an oftentimes violent world."" Adriana Serrato, founder of Xipiteca, a Latina jewelry and couture streetwear apparel brand based in Los Angeles, echoes this idea of style as a mode or protection: ""I would describe Latine style as an armor of resistance."" ""What the so-called 'mob aesthetic' and Latinx aesthetic - of which there are many - aesthetics of excess is just one of them,"" says Catherine Sue Ramírez, professor of Latin American and Latino Studies at UC Santa Cruz. ""What they have in common is an association with the un-rich."" The Mob Wife aesthetic has been characterized as nouveau riche, signaling new wealth and, perhaps, a misguided sense of what to do with it.  ""The truly wealthy hide their wealth,"" Ramírez said. In an article for the San Francisco Chronicle,writer Tony Bravo warns against glamorizing the criminality the trend invokes. He argues that the ""Mob Wife"" is a tragic figure whose excess ""amplifies a false vision of Italian femininity."" Bravo joins in on calling the aesthetic tacky and cheap and dwells on the moral impurities the aesthetic resembles. ""The mob wife aesthetic is seen as a look that has been cultivated by illicit means,"" Ramírez said. ""It's connected to this notion of deservingness - they didn't acquire their wealth from an honest day's work."" Ramírez explains that moral judgments on what is fair and rightfully earned based on work are often used against Latines and other marginalized groups, especially when it comes to ""forms of privilege and power"": ""Think about what people say about undocumented immigrants - they don't deserve to be here because they didn't get in line. They skipped the line."" For Macías, the figure ofthe Welfare Queen, a usually Black or brown hyper-sexual woman whose excessive lifestyle is imagined as being funded by the state, also plays upon a racialized societal fear of deceit and dishonesty. ""The Welfare Queen and how she operates is under constant surveillance,"" Macías said. ""[There's this] idea that people should be saving or that they should spend [extra money] on something that is more resourceful, or practical, or logical.""  In terms of style, the Welfare Queen, like the Mob Wife, is often caricatured as wearing big hair, flashy clothes, and gaudy jewelry.  ""It can look as if it's expensive. But... people are always finding deals, trading clothes, making their own or shopping at swap meets,"" Macías says.  Serrato echoes this idea, noting that often Latine style is ""a blend"" of what we see and what was once worn by ""our moms, tias, primas and sisters."" This aesthetic is actually born from working-class struggle and, as Serrato describes, is an ""expression of resilience and strength."" ""I think we're reaching for humanity,"" Macías said. ""[Style] is a profound way to express one's humanity outside the terms of our racialized class existence that overdetermines us.""

"March 25, 2024",How the Menendez brothers case blazed a trail for the true crime genre,114,"  If there were a Mount Rushmore of true crime, the faces of Erik and Lyle Menendez would certainly be on it. The 1989 murder case of the two brothers who gunned down their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills mansion predates the era of podcasting and YouTube sleuths that saturate the internet today. But their sensational trials were inescapable in the 1990s and now resonate with a new generation of obsessives. The public's enduring fascination with the case - and the changing perceptions of the brothers' defense that they were sexually abused by their father - is the focus of ""Menendez Brothers: Victims or Villains,"" a new documentary series that premieres Monday on Fox News Media's streaming service Fox Nation. ""It's the first such case in American media history that was something more than a legal story,"" Jonathan Towers, vice president of development for Fox Nation, said in an interview. ""It was a form of entertainment."" The case's powerful mixture of family dysfunction, money and violence has made it the subject of two made-for-TV movies, an upcoming Netflix series from Hollywood producer Ryan Murphy and a steady stream of documentaries over the years. It's easy to understand audiences' insatiable appetite for stories about the brothers.  Entering the living room of the family's Elm Drive home on Aug. 20, 1989, the brothers fired 12-gauge shotguns multiple times at their parents, creating a crime scene so blood-soaked even Sam Peckinpah would have looked away. After telling police that their parents were murdered, the brothers went on a conspicuous spending spree before they were arrested for the crime. At their trials, defense teams said they were driven to kill after years of being physically and sexually abused by their father.  Their first trial in 1993 ended in hung juries. They were re-tried and convicted in 1996 and are serving prison sentences of life without parole at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego. The first Menendez trial took place when cameras in the courtroom were still novel and cable TV was growing. Courtroom video became programming for Court TV, one of the early signature networks of the then expanding multi-channel universe.  Instead of sketches or print and TV journalism accounts, viewers watched the criminal justice system play out in real time. The shared experience of observing the proceedings made the Menendez brothers ubiquitous. Every facial expression was scrutinized, as ""Victims or Villains,"" produced by the Los Angeles-based Pilgrim Media Group, depicts with dozens of vintage video clips. Los Angeles commuters heard KFI radio hosts JohnKobyltand KenChiampou riff daily on the topic. Network news and tabloid shows such as ""A Current Affair"" featured the story every night. Loftier venues such as Charlie Rose's PBS talk show and ABC's ""Nightline"" with Ted Koppel weighed in as well. The Menendez brothers paved the way for the live-from-L.A. legal saga of O.J. Simpson that began in 1994. The televised trial of the actor and former football star for the killing of his wife Nicole Brown Smith and her friend Ron Goldman was such a ratings draw it dealt a blow to network daytime soap operas from which they would never recover.  True crime sagas and court cases went on to become the main source material for network newsmagazines such as ""Dateline"" and ""48 Hours."" They have proliferated on dedicated cable networks such as Investigation Discovery, supplied streaming platforms, and serve as a massive driver for podcasts such as Ashley Flowers' ""Crime Junkie."" Murdoch family-controlled Fox News Media has turned to true crime to build its Fox Nation streaming business. The platform, which has 2 million paid subscribers, is stocking up on investigative documentaries that can attract a younger audience than that of the company's conservative-leaning cable news channel. But what may be the most jarring aspect of ""Victims or Villains"" is how the Menendez brothers were a source of laughs. They were depicted in sketches on ""Saturday Night Live"" and spoofed by Jay Leno on ""The Tonight Show."" (Both shows lampooned the Simpson trial as well as Leno featured a dancing troupe of Judge Lance Ito lookalikes). ""It is fascinating to see how it was a matter of comedy back then,"" Towers said. ""It would not be today."" ""Victims or Villains"" examines how the media frenzy around the Menendez brothers permeated through the public perception of the case. Their defense was called ""the abuse excuse"" by some legal pundits and critics. ""Are we on the verge of substituting a talk show empathy for our criminal code?"" Koppel asked his ""Nightline"" viewers. The documentary also explores how the ridicule the juries and prosecutors were subjected to after the mistrial affected the second trial that ended with a conviction. Those latter proceedings were not televised. But the public understanding of the trauma sexual abuse can have on children, including among men, has evolved over the years. Various cases involving the molestation of children by members of the Catholic Church, the trial of Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky and actors speaking out about abuse have altered the once-taboo conversation. Comedian and actor Rosie O'Donnell, a victim of sexual abuse, appears in ""Victims or Villains"" as an advocate for the brothers and the validity of their claims. She has been joined by the droves of young social media users who have discovered the case. During the COVID-19 shutdowns, the current iteration of Court TV - a digital over-the-air network owned by Scripps - aired the Menendez trial in its entirety; it is also available via streaming. Captive viewers tuned in and many took to TikTok to express support for the siblings and their contention that abuse drove them to kill. The changing public sentiment comes as the current legal team for the Menendez brothers seeks a new hearing based on recently discovered evidence purporting to show their father had also molested Roy Rosselló, when the singer was a 14-year-old member of the boy band Menudo.  The Menendez lawyers contend the new evidence corroborates the brothers' claims and supports the argument that they should have been convicted of manslaughter instead of first-degree murder. The doubters remain. Pam Bozanich, a member of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's prosecution team for the first Mendendez trial, has sat for 14 documentary interviews over the years. In ""Victims or Villains,"" she still maintains the brothers fabricated the story of their father's abuse.  ""The facts in this case are irrefutable,"" Bozanich said. ""Except for the ones about Jose being a child molester.""  This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"February 15, 2024",I Love the Concept of 'Little Treat Culture' - But What's It Teaching My Kids?,115,"  A few weeks ago, after a stressful and overwhelming few days, I decided to treat myself to an iced latte and a pastry before running errands. I told myself it would lift my mood ... and sure enough, it did. It may have just been the sheer factor of having time alone, which is a rarity for me as a work-from-home mom. But a few days later, on a Target run with my kids, I decided to add a new pajama setto my cart, and I felt that same little mood-lifting thrill.  There's something about treating yourself to a little something - a fun coffee drink, an Amazon Prime steal, a cookie after lunch - that feels luxurious and indulgent, albeit without the guilt or stress associated with actual luxury or indulgence. Because while TikTok content can certainly be a vehicle for misinformation or problematic messaging, there's one TikTok trend I can get on board with: Little treat culture. Little treat culture is all about treating yourself to a little something fun when you're stressed or sad or even just inconvenienced. Think: Grabbing a cupcake after a long day at work, or buying a new lipstick while picking up a prescription. Think of it as the TikTokified (and often less expensive) version of retail therapy. This hits differently when you're a mom. We tend to be so consumed with doing for our kids and households, we put ourselves on the back burner. So when we do give ourselves permission to buy the $20 pajama set, or sit and drink the overpriced latte, it feels like we're pouring into our own cups for a change. But when we pull ourselves out of the moment, we have to do that thing moms can't help but do: We have to wonder how our personal relationships with little treat culture will affect our kids. It's no secret that social media promotes consumerism. I'd be lying if I said that I, a fully grown woman, am immune to the pull of wanting more and more based on what I see online. So how is this going to affect my kids? How will they learn to distinguish between healthy indulgences and unnecessary ones? And if I, their ultimate influencer, fall under the influence myself, how will that affect them down the line? According to Courtney Morgan, Licensed Therapist (LPCC) & Founder at Counseling Unconditionally, watching a parent enjoy little treat culture won't necessarily harm kids. ""I do not believe that 'little treat culture' is significantly impactful to children,"" Morgan tells SheKnows. ""I believe the insignificant impacts would be positive, such as watching their parent experience joy in something small, or seeing someone online add a little fun to their typical day. [It's] about making the mundane a little bit more exciting."" But as always, there's a healthy balance we need to strike. ""It would be negative if a person were to cause financial stress over their need for 'little treats',"" says Morgan. Morgan is right: Little treat culture is subjective. What feels like an insignificant spend to one family may be a big deal to another, and social media can't always be the blueprint. Sure, your favorite influencer may share that her life has improved since she started treating herself to Starbucks every morning, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the right move for everyone. Like the concept of self-care, which took on a really commodified flavor thanks to social media, little treat culture requires limitations - and it can't take the place of actually taking care of ourselves. Treating myself to a new nail polish is no substitute for facing stressors head on, getting enough rest, and staying on top of my physical and mental health. Ultimately, I want my kids to see that example and apply it to their own lives. I don't want them to think that buying a new Stanley cup will fix all their problems, because at the end of the day, it simply won't.  According to psychologist Ray Christner, Psy.D., my kids won't necessarily think they can use a little treat as a replacement for true self-care just because they hear their mom say, ""Ugh, I'm having a rough day, let's go get ice cream"". That is, as long as I model balance and moderation, and keep a few things in mind. ""The 'little treat culture' is really interesting, and if used the right way, it can be great for both adults and kids,"" Christner tells SheKnows. ""Let's start with the good stuff. Rewarding yourself can be a great motivator. In fact, there is science to show that when we treat ourselves, we get a 'dopamine boost.' This is associated with pleasure, so it has a positive impact on mood. For kids watching, this can be an effective way to learn about rewarding themselves when they achieve something, as they will model behaviors of others. The other piece is self-care. These little treats can show children that it's okay to take a break and treat ourselves."" However, it's not all good, and we have to be mindful of the fact that little treat culture can become a crutch or make us overly reliant on those instant dopamine hits as coping strategies. In our world of social media-driven consumerism, it's really important that we teach kids that materialism needs to have its limits. ""If the treats are always about buying stuff or immediate pleasures, it might teach kids to be more materialistic or always want instant rewards,"" says Christner. ""When these treats are all over social media, kids might start thinking they need to keep up. This social comparison can make them feel bad about themselves or their own lives."" One thing that may be helpful? We can teach our kids that it's not just the thing we acquire, but also the experience of acquiring it that feels so good. So maybe, instead of focusing just on the new toy you bought your child, you talk about how much fun you had going to the store and choosing something new together. ""I think the trick to the 'little treats culture' is balance,"" says Christner. ""It's also important to mix in 'treats' that aren't about material things - like hanging out together, making your favorite dinner, enjoying a hobby, or just relaxing.""

As someone who has piles and piles of beauty products on her desk to test for work, I'm not easily influenced (even if 80 percent of my FYP on TikTok is creators convincingly hawking glosses and concealers that are supposed to ""change my life""). But when I saw a few videos of people showing their before and afters with NYX Duck Plump Lip Gloss ($13), I knew I had to try it, too. These influencers legitimately looked like they just got back from lip filler appointments. Could a drugstore gloss really give my pout a fresh-injected look?  @michaelascott20 Nyx DUCK PLUMP ? shes spicy!! #nyxduckplump #nyxcosmetics #lipplumper #nyxlipgloss #virallipplumper #trending #tiktokbeauty #tiktokshopfinds #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt #fyp original sound - Michaelascott Turns out, yeah?  My Honest Review of NYX Duck Plump High Pigment Lip Gloss I decided to test the shade ""Pick Me Pink,"" which feels spring-y, and nicely pigmented, but nothing over the top. It's a classic, rose-y pink that should be flattering on everyone and look good with any outfit. Plus, I was at the office, and didn't feel like doing anything that would stand out, lest I had a meeting and things went wrong (in my mind, I'm imagining Kris Jenner's lip filler fiasco - welp).  NYX Duck Plump Plumping Lip Gloss Buy Now on ulta $13 Buy Now on nyx $13 Shades: 18Pros:Easy to useEffectively plumps lips with one swipeComes in a wide variety of shadesReasonable priceVeganNot tested on animalsCons:Results are exaggerated on TikTokDoes sting lips like any other plumping gloss product Luckily, things went according to plan. The formula was a bit thicker than I anticipated; with plumping glosses I'm used to a more watery formulation, but this stuff reminded me of the thickness of a matte liquid lip (minus the matte-ness). I was a little nervous applying it, but with ""Pick Me Pink,"" it was easy. It glided on easily, giving my lips a sweet rose-y tint and ultra glossy finish in one swipe. I ended up waiting about seven-eight minutes in between first applying and taking an ""after"" photo. Here are the results: The Plumping Effect Okay - I will say, I think the influencers on TikTok are maybe(???) using a filter, because my lips didn't look, like, surgically altered. But they looked a lot fuller, and the formula gave me the same plumpness as more expensive products like Too Faced Lip Injection ($29). This lasted for about an hour for me before reapplying. So, A for effectiveness. The Plumping Sensation About two minutes after applying, my lips started to sting. The formula features spicy ginger, which is a popular plumping ingredient, and the packaging does warn you that you'll experience an ""extreme"" sensation. Don't wear this if your lips are chapped! It will be painful! The pinching was definitely on the more extreme side (a bit more intense than Too Faced, IMO), but this was to be expected. The Bottom Line This is a fun lip product if you're looking to fake lip fullness in minutes, and I love that it comes in so many shades. It really feels like a marriage between a traditional lipstick (the pigment) and lip gloss (the shine), except with intense plumping features. Did it look like I just got back from a lip injection appointment? Well, no. But it did enhance the size and shape of my mouth, and it was just as effective as pricier products. Worth the TikTok hype? I'd say so.

"March 28, 2024",I Write About Costco for a Living & These are My Best Money-Saving Hacks,117,"  Few stores rival Costco's appeal for cost-conscious consumers and savvy shoppers. As a writer specializing in all things Costco, I've had the privilege of diving deep into the warehouse giant's aisles, uncovering hidden gems, and mastering the art of saving money while enjoying its quality products.  On my blog, Warehouse Wanderer, I help readers maximize their membership benefits by examining prices to identify the best sales, providing honest product reviews with thorough research and taste-testing, and divulging insider tips and tricks. Through countless visits and careful research, I've found several money-saving Costco hacks that elevate the everyday shopping experience.  Today, I am unveiling some of my best strategies for maximizing value and minimizing cost within Costco's sprawling aisles. Whether you're a superfan like me or a newcomer eager to navigate its vast offerings, prepare to embark on a journey towards smarter spending and greater satisfaction with every purchase. Freeze Your Rotisserie Chicken  Even people who aren't Costco fanatics know about the famous $4.99 rotisserie chickens - and for good reason - they're delicious. The famous $5 chicken is easily one of the best deals in the warehouse so my first tip is to grab an extra one (or two, or three) to freeze at home during your next visit. I've experimented with various freezing methods and discovered that removing the meat from the bone is the most effective approach. Removing the meat makes it easier to defrost and reheat when needed. Simply place the meat in a freezer bag and store it for up to three months, although I recommend using it within a month for optimal taste. To defrost, place it in the refrigerator overnight, then reheat it using a microwave. You'll save time and money and you'll get the additional bonus of not having to cook a thing.  Learn the Pricing System The last two digits of an item's price hold a wealth of info; standard pricing ends in .99, while prices set by the manufacturer end in .79, .69, and .49. If you see a .97, the item is being discontinued, so snatch it up. Manager's Specials end in .88 and .00, which means the price is likely only at this location and has limited availability. Decode The Product Tags The product tags offer a wealth of information beyond the price and a quick glance can reveal a lot. Green tags indicate organic products, and if you spot an asterisk in the top right corner, it's called the ""death star,"" which indicates that the product is being discontinued. When you see this symbol, you should stock up on the product because it will soon no longer be available at a Costco-worthy price. To find the item number, look just above the product name on the item card.  Take Advantage of the Pre-Made Meals In the refrigerated vegetable section, you'll find convenient bagged salads that make perfect work lunch shortcuts. These ready-to-go kits contain all the ingredients for a quick and tasty meal. While popular options like Caesar and Mediterranean Crunch are usually available, you'll also find seasonal products that rotate in, like the current Thai Chili Mango, ensuring your lunches stay exciting. You can also pick up some of the ready-made sandwiches, wraps, and even tacos for easy and delicious zero-prep lunches.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Costco (@costco) Time Your Visits This tip is less about money and more about bettering your Costco experience, but it's worth noting because we all know how miserable a packed Costco warehouse can be. I have found that Tuesdays through Thursdays tend to have the least shoppers. Mornings are best, and while you may be turned off by those waiting for the doors to open, shoppers quickly disperse, so it ends up not being a concern. Most stores open at 10 a.m. and I've found the optimal time to arrive is 10:30 a.m. This timing allows the Instacart shoppers to finish their early orders, the big rush hasn't begun, and since samples typically start at 11:00 a.m., you can indulge without the masses.  You Don't Need A Membership To Shop Last year, aTikTok went viral for revealing a hack that allows non-members to take advantage of all the deals at Costco. The popular TikTok explained that all you have to do is know someone with an active membership and ask them to purchase a gift card for you. That way, non-members can enter the warehouse and shop without a membership. While this technically could save you money, we don't recommend this method as Costco is cracking down on these tricks. A sign at our local store states, ""Members are welcome to bring guests into the warehouse and as a reminder, only active, paid members may purchase merchandise.""  You can shop at Costco with a friend with an active membership and ask them to pay for you, but the easier (and way more convenient option) is to have your Costco haul delivered to your door through Instacart. Instacart's prices are slightly higher than in-store Costco prices but it's still usually a good bargain considering how much product you are receiving.  Don't Skip the Pantry Aisle In my opinion, the best deals at Costco are found outside the refrigerated and freezer sections. Yes, you should still absolutely check out those sections, but also be sure to not skip the spices and pantry aisles. Here you'll find famous brand-name products like Kinder's The Blend Seasoning and Bachan's Japanese BBQ Sauce for up to 50% less than other retailers.

"March 14, 2024",I'm a Disneyland-Obsessed Shopping Editor & Can Confirm These Are the Comfiest Shoes to Wear at the Park,118,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. I'm one of those adults who love going to Disneyland. As a Southern California native, I've been going since I was a baby, and that love for the parks is still very much present today. While I don't make it out there as much as I used to, I still make try to go at least once a month if I can. So I definitely know how it feels to reach the end of a 16+ hour day and have your feet feel completely done. We're talking done to the point that you'd rather sleep on a bench at Downtown Disney for the night than have to walk all the way back to the car.  The Best Shoes for Disney at a Glance Best Shoes for Disney Overall: On Cloudnova Sneaker, $150Best Affordable Shoes for Disney: Akk Womens Walking Shoes, $40Best Lightweight Shoes for Disney: New Balance Women's FuelCore Nergize V1 Sneaker, $65Best Hoka Sneakers for Disney: Hoka Clifton 9 Running Shoe, $145Best TikTok-Viral Shoes for Disney: Adidas Astir, $65Best Shoes With Arch Support for Disney: Hoka Bondi 8 Running Shoe, $165Best Celebrity-Endorsed Shoes for Disney: Cariuma OCA Low, $89 To be completely honest, I was never really one to care about wearing proper footwear since I used to go pretty regularly. There was even a time in my life where I would walk back and forth between Disneyland and DCA wearing flip-flops, no matter how much my feet hurt at the end of the day. But for my most recent trip, I wanted to buy a pair of sneakers that not only looked cute, but would keep my feet comfy and happy all day long.  After doing some research and going back and forth on a few brands, I found ""The One"" and couldn't be happier. So if you're looking for the best shoes to wear to Disneyland, I've got some of the best options for you below. The Best Shoes for Disneyland: Editor's Pick EDITOR'S PICK On Cloudnova Sneaker $150 Buy Now The On Cloudnova Sneaker kept my feet from completely dying on me at the end of a 12+ hour day at Disney. It's described as a ""runner-tech comfort meets street-ready attitude sneaker"" that features ""performance cushioning technologies."" From the moment I tried them on, I was in love. They fit so comfortable, they really had a ""cloud""-like feel, and your toes have a lot of space to move around. I bought these a few days before my trip and didn't even need to break them in. They were super comfy from the get-go. During my Disneyland trip, I stood and walked around A LOT. It was a super busy day so lines were insane. The newest attraction, Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway broke down, so we waited an hour standing around in holding room while they got that fixed. Plus, we spent a majority of the day walking all around the park and Downtown Disney. We were there from about noon to midnight, and usually I'd be dying at the end of the night. But with these, I was perfectly fine. Zero complaints.  But don't just take my word for it. Here are the shoes other Disney lovers can't hit the theme park without - from TikTokers to regular folks we asked.  Best Affordable Shoes for Disney Akk Womens Walking Shoes $40 Buy Now If you're looking for something that won't necessarily break the bank, look no further than these shoes from Amazon. They're less than $40 and have glowing reviews. They were designed to be lightweight, feature a memory foam insole for your total comfort, and come in a ton of different colors. You're sure to find one that fits your sense of style. Plus, they're slip-on (they just have a laces look), which make them extra convenient.One Amazon shopper said they were absolutely perfect. They wrote, ""Right out of the box, I was able to wear them for long days of walking at Disney World with no blisters or aching."" Best Lightweight Shoe for Disney New Balance Women's FuelCore Nergize V1 Sneaker $65 Buy Now You can't go wrong with a pair of New Balance sneakers, especially when they're an Amazon best-seller with over 42,900 five-star reviews. The shoes feature the brand's signature Memory Sole Comfort Insert that offers a ""plush feel with every step."" They're cute, lightweight, and come in several color options.A number of Amazon shoppers wore these during their Disneyland trip and many raved over how super comfortable they were. As one wrote, ""Bought these right before a trip to Disneyland because I knew we'd be walking all day. Didn't even break them in, but didn't have to! AMAZING SHOES, I love them!! So comfortable! Walked over 20,000 steps for four days straight! No sore back, no sore feet or legs! 100% WOULD BUY AGAIN!"" Another shopper called these ""Disneyland-worthy."" Best Eco-Friendly Shoe for Disney Cariuma Salvas $129 Buy Now Brooke Shields was just spotted wearing a pair of Cariuma's Salvas sneakers at the airport, and it's not hard to see why she chose these shoes for traveling. Not only do they totally have that casual-cool vibe, they were made to be ultra-comfy as well. I actually took a trip to Walt Disney World late last year and brought these along. I wore these from rope drop to closing with zero problems. I didn't get any blisters and my heels weren't dying at the end of the day, which they sometimes can when I'm standing for hours. Plus, Cariuma prides themselves on being an eco-friendly brand, so you'll be supporting a company that keeps the environment in mind.  Best Compliment-Worthy Shoe for Disney Skechers Uno - Night Shades $85 Buy Now One of my favorite things about going to Disneyland is getting to wear all kinds of fun things that I wouldn't wear normally. Like these bright green sneakers from Skechers, for instance. I don't know how many times I've been told ""cool shoes"" or ""I like your shoes"" while making my way through the crowded, dark hallways of The Haunted Mansion. Yes, they glow. They're super comfortable as well. If you're not vibing the bright green, they're also available in hot pink, purple, and blue.  Best Hoka Sneakers for Disney Hoka Clifton 9 Running Shoe $145 Buy Now This isn't the only pair of Hoka sneakers to make the list, but it's definitely one of the best shoes for Disneyland or Walt Disney World overall. This Cameron Diaz-worn style is popular among Hoka fans for being super lightweight, roomy, and so comfortable, you feel like you're walking on clouds. As one reviewer wrote, these shoes are ""perfect"" for Disney. ""These arrived the night before leaving for Disney,"" they said. ""I was worried I'd get blisters the first time wearing them, but I didn't! My feet didn't hurt at all after a week walking around the parks. I'm now a Hoka lifer!""  Best Slip-On Shoes for Disney S Sport by Skechers Malvina Slip-On Performance Sneakers $35 Buy Now Frequent Disney-goer Melissa Tornabene says, ""For the first few years I wore slip-on Skechers and they became my Disney sneakers."" Skechers have a reputation for all-day comfort, and this pair is ""perfect...if you are on your feet for long hours,"" writes one Target reviewer. The easy on-and-off style makes them extra Disney-friendly, and shoppers love the all-black look. ""Makes it more dressy and less of an athletic shoe.""

Chuck Taylor All Star Lift High Top Platform Sneakers are the shoes of choice because they have a thicky, cushiony platform that will support your soles from the Magic Kingdom all the way to the Typhoon Lagoon.

"March 27, 2024","I'm a Pregnant Shopping Editor, & These Are the Maternity Leggings I Can't Live Without",119,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission.As someone who basically lived in leggings pre-pregnancy, I knew my very first investment in pregnancy gear would be maternity leggings, specifically designed to support a growing belly. It's my first pregnancy, so there's still so much I'm learning - even for a shopping editor who's written and researched maternity gear for work. Like, did I even really need maternity leggings, or can I just throw on any old stretchy pair? ""You'll definitely need maternity leggings,"" my boss, SHE Media Chief Content Officer Cristina Velocci informed me. Later, speaking with a urogynecologist, I learned why: As the bump grows, it really helps to have a waist that covers the midline of the belly and provides support and comfort. Best Maternity Leggings at a Glance Best Overall: Beyond Yoga, Spacedye Love the Bump Midi Maternity Legging, $108Best Runner-Up: Ingrid+Isabel, The Performance Legging, $88Best Non-Maternity: Lululemon, Align High-Rise Mini Flared Leggings, $118Best Seamless: Knix, BlissFit Maternity Leggings, $50Best Affordable Performance Leggings: Quince, Performance Maternity & Postpartum Leggings, $30 If you're in the same boat as I was a few weeks ago, you're in the right place! For the past two months, I've been testing a handful of top athleisure brands' maternity (and one non-maternity) offerings to find out exactly which maternity leggings are the very best. I'm currently 17 weeks along (the last time I updated this was at the 13-week mark!), so I'll be updating this article every month or so with more selections and updated photos of how my leggings fit my growing bump, giving you the best of the best intel essentially in real-ish time. What To Look for in Maternity Leggings - According to an Expert Urogynecologist and co-author of A Woman's Guide to Her Pelvic Floor: What the F*@# is Going On Down There ($20), Dr. Victoria Scott tells us that, most importantly, leggings should be flexible and supportive for pregnancy. ""You also want to make sure they are breathable so you don't overheat,"" she says. Something I will definitely take into consideration, considering my third trimester is smack dab in the middle of summer. ""It is common to have swelling in your legs during pregnancy and leggings with adequate support can help improve circulation and reduce swelling,"" Dr. Scott adds. While you're likely to make due with regular leggings when your bump is small (your first trimester), ""you will probably prefer leggings with a waist that goes under the belly"" as you get bigger. ""You may find leggings with a waist that fits at the midline of your belly or over it to be more comfortable,"" Dr. Scott says. What to Avoid in Maternity Leggings, According to an Expert Comfort is key - so if your leggings aren't making you feel good, they're probably not the ones you want to wear. This seems obvious, but I tried wearing a pair of regular Spanx faux leather leggings the other night for my sister's birthday dinner, and I was regretting my decision after appetizers. So, truly, not all leggings are created equal when it comes to staying comfy while pregnant. ""Make sure leggings are not too tight and you are comfortable,"" Dr. Scott says, adding, ""You also want to make sure they are opaque and do not become transparent with stretching."" Stretchy, soft material is key. Look for materials like Elastane, nylon, spandex, and four-way stretch. Another factor to consider is color. ""Black and dark colors are great, because they can hide the inevitable urinary incontinence with laughing or sneezing that comes along with your growing belly,"" Dr. Scott says.

The Best Maternity Leggings I've Tested in 2024 BEST OVERALL Beyond Yoga, Spacedye Love the Bump Midi Maternity Legging Buy Now $108 I've been a big fan of Beyond Yoga for years. The brand has the most comfortable, soft medium-to-low impact leggings (perfect for yoga, walks, jogs, and lounging) made with their proprietary Spacedye material, a buttery fabric that feels like nothing at all. So, I wasn't surprised when I tried their maternity leggings and instantly fell in love with them. They're currently in my top rotation, and the pair that will get me through first, second, and third trimester feeling comfy and supported.While I'm only 13 weeks and have a small bump, I've found myself resisting anything with too much compression. Even though at this point, Baby is the size of a lemon (aww), I'm constantly bloated (sorry, TMI) and need a gentle, forgiving (four-way stretch) fabric that lets me live my life. I've walked, napped, and lounged around in these (I honestly haven't had the energy to go back to the gym, so TBD on that front), and have honestly forgotten to take them off at night before going to sleep. These also don't require extra care when washing: Just throw them in the washer and dry along with the rest of your clothes. As a nice bonus, the material also offers UV protection. I ordered my normal size, which fit, but some reviewers did say they had to size up.The Love the Bump maternity leggings are what I consider my ""Goldilocks"" find: They're not too compressive, not too loose - they're juuuuust right.Sizes available: XS-XLColors: 7Material: 87% polyester, 13% ElastanePros:High-qualityPajama-like feelGreat for all stages of pregnancyTons of color optionsEasy to take care ofUV protection Cons:Pricey BEST RUNNER-UP Ingrid+Isabel, The Performance Legging Buy Now $88 I am officially in that in-between, is-she-pregnant-or-did-she-just-have-a-big-breakfast stage (almost 17 weeks), which means literally none of my regular clothes fit, but most maternity wear still has too much fabric. So, I've continued living in leggings, and this pair from Ingrid+Isabel are my latest to try out. Spoiler alert! I love them. The performance leggings are actually designed for movement, but I chose to wear them to the office with an oversized chambray button-up. The material has that shiny almost Spanx-like appearance, so I thought it actually looked very elevated and cute with my Rothy's flats - but I can see why these would be so clutch at the gym. They're ultra breathable, offer the perfect amount of compression, and move with you wherever you go. They also stand out in that they have a crossover design in the back, which makes my butt look good. I'm a big fan!Sizes available: XS-XLColors: 1Material: 83% REPREVE® polyester, 17% spandex, 100% cotton gussetPros:High-qualityGreat for all stages of pregnancyEasy to take care ofAre technically a workout legging, but look elevated enough for everyday wearVery stretchyFlattering crossover panel in the backCons:Only comes in black BEST NON-MATERNITY MATERNITY LEGGINGS Lululemon, Align High-Rise Mini-Flared Pant Regular Buy Now $118 I've been dying to try a pair of Lululemon Align flares (what can I say, I'm easily TikTok-influenced!), so I was relieved to find out that a lot of pregnant people actually swear by them even though they're not specifically designed for maternity wear. After testing out a pair of a few weeks, I can attest that these are a great pair of non-maternity leggings that provide enough stretch and give for a growing tummy - although I will report back when I'm bigger.I wear the Align High-Rise flares when, simply put, I want to look more put together. It turns out, ""looking put together"" is Herculean task these days, since I absolutely feel like a slug no matter what I wear or do or think. These make me feel cute and stylish, even if I'm wearing them with UGG boots or, in the photo above, my favorite pair of fluffy Birkenstocks with socks. I could easily wear these to the office with some cute sneakers and nice sweater, and I don't think anyone would bat an eye that I'm rolling in wearing leggings.Made with Lululemon's legendary Nulu fabric, these are soft and weightless - perfect for low-to-medium impact activities like yoga or napping (my preferred workout routine lately). The four-way stretch is ultra forgiving as my bump (and thighs and butt) grow, and the material is also sweat-wicking which comes in clutch as apparently all the hormones make me sweat profusely all the time (again, sorry, TMI). They're also just very, very flattering. I think they accentuate my features and kind of suck everything in without acting compressive at all. Overall, big win in my book.For washing, wash with similar colors, machine wash cold, and tumblr dry low for best upkeep.Sizes available: 0-20Colors: 7Material: 81% nylon, 19 % Lycra® ElastanePros:High-qualitySuper flatteringGreat for pre- and post-pregnancyCons:PriceyMay not be supportive enough later in pregnancy BEST SEAMLESS Knix, BlissFit Maternity Legging Buy Now $50 As someone who loves Knixperiod undies, I was excited to try their maternity legging offering: The BlissFit Maternity Legging. Can confirm: The leggings live up to their name. What makes the BlissFit leggings stand out from the crowd is their seamless design and ample tummy panel (which while I haven't grown into yet, provides tons and tons of room for when Baby gets bigger). They look very sleek (more like tights vs. leggings), and they provide ample amount of stretching. They're also a bit more compressive than the rest of the leggings I've tried so far, which makes me wonder what they'll be like at the gym - I'll definitely report back on this once I have the energy to walk more than five minutes at a time. Unlike the Love the Bump and Align leggings, these aren't super soft - the material is lightweight and feels good on the skin, but it's not the type of leggings you'll forget you're wearing and fall asleep in (although, I've fallen asleep in them several times already!) Compared to the other leggings I'm testing, the price tag on these is also far more reasonable. So, if you're looking for a solid pair of black, seamless leggings, I've really loved the BlissFit so far.When washing, use the cold cycle. Air dry to keep its shape.Sizes available: S-XXXLColors: 1Material: 90% polyamide, 10% spandexPros:One of the only seamless maternity leggings on the marketGives sleek lookReasonably-pricedIdeal for growing, bigger bellies (think third trimester)High-qualityBest size rangeCons:Comes in one colorIsn't the softest material BEST AFFORDABLE PERFORMANCE MATERNITY LEGGINGS Quince, Performance Maternity & Postpartum Leggings Buy Now $30 These leggings reminded me a lot of the Oprah-beloved brand Girlfriend Collective's Compressive Pocket Legging (and it's likely a dupe, as Quince is known for creating more affordable versions of popular products). My absolute favorite aspect about these was the pocket - none of my other leggings had this feature! And I'm always carrying something in my pocket, whether it's my phone or some dog treats. Another plus? The price. At just under $30, you get a good deal for a decent pair of leggings that are designed to actually support your activities. While I know these are performance leggings, I haven't actually tried them at the gym yet (if you scrolled past the other leggings reviews, just know that I haven't made it back to the gym since finding out I was pregnant), but I have taken long dog walks with them, and I've also worn them while cleaning the house, which is totally a workout if you're pregnant and zapped of any energy. Unlike the other leggings, these feel like sporty leggings. They're not buttery, and they don't feel like they could be pajamas - I'd only wear these if I have a bunch of movement on my schedule. With that said, there's a lot to love about these: They offer four-way stretch, they're moisture-wicking and have anti-bacterial properties (great if you sweat a lot), and they dry fast. The full panel waistband also offers plenty of room for a growing belly, so this is a great pair of leggings that'll last you from first to third trimester.Are they the most snuggly leggings? Not really, honestly. BUT snuggly-ness isn't quite their function. So, if you're looking for a good workout legging that won't break the bank, this pair from Quince will do the trick.Sizes available: XS-XLColors: 2Material: 78% nylon, 22% spandexPros:Great for those who sweat a lotBuilt-in anti-microbial propertiesHas pocketEasy on the walletCons:Not softNot the most flattering More from SheKnows Zappos Is Having a Secret Sandals Sale Featuring Martha Stewart's Comfy Skechers, Crocs & More - Starting at $11 Classification   Language: ENGLISH Publication-Type: Web Publication Journal Code: SheKnowsLexisNexis Subject: PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH (90%); WRITERS (77%); RANKINGS (72%); YOGA (67%) Company: BEST INC (90%); LULULEMON ATHLETICA INC (55%) Ticker: BEST (NYSE) (90%); LULU (NASDAQ) (55%) Industry: SIC5999 MISCELLANEOUS RETAIL STORES, NEC (90%); NAICS339920 SPORTING & ATHLETIC GOODS MANUFACTURING (55%); NAICS458110 CLOTHING AND CLOTHING ACCESSORIES RETAILERS (55%); MATERNITY & NURSING WEAR (90%); HOSIERY (89%); ACTIVEWEAR & SPORTSWEAR (77%); WRITERS (77%); FASHION INDUSTRY (72%) Load-Date: March 26, 2024"
"March 25, 2024","If You're Not Sure How to Teach Your Kids About Money, Start Here",120,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. For a lot of us growing up, money was a taboo topic - or at the very least, something that wasn't brought up much (if at all). We may have had the odd unit on balancing a checkbook or making a budget during a home economics class, but teaching personal finances and money management didn't seem to be a primary concern for either our parents or our educators ... especially for girls, who historically were not expected to even care much about finances, let alone be the primary breadwinner or money manager (thanks, patriarchy). Things are different these days, though, and money is a topic to be explored and explained, not swept under the proverbial rug. Through podcasts, workshops, and self-help books, we can learn how to make our finances work for us - and in turn, teach our kids how to do the same.  One financial-literacy advocate leading the charge for change is Alexa von Tobel, founder of Inspired Capital and financial planning company LearnVest. She's the host of The Founders Project podcast. She's the New York Times bestselling author of Financially Fearless and Financially Forward. And now she's extending her expertise to a new audience: girls. Her newest book, Rebel Girls Money Matters: A Guide to Saving, Spending, and Everything in Between, was just released today - and it aims to teach tween girls (ages 8-12) the basics of a strong financial foundation, addressing budgeting, investing, credit, even the pay gap! Rebel Girls Money Matters: A Guide to Saving, Spending, and Everything in Between Buy Now On Amazon $12.99 SheKnows had a Q&A session with von Tobel, where we asked for her best advice on talking to kids (boys and girls!) about money. Here's the valuable info she shared. SK: What's the most important thing for kids to learn about money? AvT: It's so critical that we teach our kids that money is a tool. How we feel about money throughout our lives is heavily influenced by our associations with money as a kid, so now is the perfect time to set your kids up for a healthy mindset.  As you start to teach them how money works, keep it tangible! At only four years old, we gave my oldest daughter (who's now nine) a variety of different-sized piggy banks so she could visually see the act of earning money and saving it for items she wanted - big and small. For instance, the smaller piggy bank was used for short-term goals: things she wanted within a month and were smaller cost items, like an ice cream cone or lemonade. The larger piggy bank was for things way out into the future - like a new bicycle or college savings.  When you give your kids actual coins and bills to handle and count, they can see their savings grow, which can be very motivating! You can even think about creating a visual representation of their goal by printing out a picture of the item, attaching it to the piggy bank, and helping them track their progress towards it.  SK: What's one thing that parents don't teach their kids often enough, money-wise? Is there any way in which you frequently notice parents are getting it wrong? AvT: One of the best lessons to teach our kids is how to make your money work for you. While compounding interest might seem too complex, it's something you can start to instill at a young age. If we delay gratification - like putting money into a bank account that earns interest - we'll have even more on the other side.  Sometimes many of the money conversations we have focus on the immediate fun of spending or giving allowances for chores. But it's just as important to talk about the future too. What are your family's budgeting and saving goals? Budgeting isn't about restricting spending, it's about empowering our kids to shape their financial choices. It gives them agency and accountability, building a positive relationship with finances and money.  Once they have a clear goal in place, help them set up a bank account that actually pays interest and show them how compounding interest will help them reach their goals even faster. SK: What are some practical ways to infuse financial education into our kids' daily lives? AvT: It's really important to make money feel real. This is especially true in such a digital world where things magically appear at the door (without them ever seeing money exchange hands). Literally put bills and coins on the table and make it a topic that you talk about and work through so they can start to learn about money early on.  Maybe you start with a piggy bank, and then when your child is older, take them to the bank and let them physically see the money being taken out to go buy something - they will start to very quickly connect the dots. You can also encourage entrepreneurism at a young age - whether it's a lemonade stand or volunteering to do more chores around the house for some extra money. My daughter has a bracelet business. She sells them for $5 and quickly sees the value of her hard work and how her earnings add up toward her goals.  SK: As an expert, what (and how) do you personally teach your kids about money - what's the best financial advice you're passing on to your own children? AvT: I've learned that starting with the basics is key! I like to start with how to prioritize essential expenses, like food and transportation. This skill will help them make informed choices and avoid impulsive spending later in life. Starting young and developing the complexity of how you explain this will make it so much easier for them to understand and apply these skills!  No matter the specific lesson, I make sure to talk about money in front of them, and I do so in a positive tone. I never want them to associate money with something too complicated or too scary to learn about. It should be a topic they feel empowered in and eager to learn more about as they grow. SK: What's the best way to discuss money with young kids? How about teens? AvT: When talking to your kids about money, ground it in things they can understand. How many times does your kid ask you for something, and your response is ""No way, that toy costs $200?"" To a young child, they can't conceptualize what $200 is - but if you said, ""Wow, that would be 800 quarters!"" it puts things into perspective for them. And most importantly, watch your tone. It's hard, but critical. The tone of how money is talked about matters. If it's a source of stress, then it creates an overwhelming association. But, if you are matter-of-fact when discussing money with your kids, especially with teens, it goes a really long way and sets your kids up for success.  Keep it tangible. Be matter-of-fact. Make it fun!  SK: Should you be honest with your kids about your family finances? Are there financial topics you shouldn't discuss with them?  AvT: Yes! We need to move on from this outdated view on money being secretive. It's so important to talk to your kids about finances so that they can have a healthy relationship with money when they're older. There is new research that shows if you grew up in a house where money is not talked about and is kept behind the scenes - maybe because it was a stressful topic or socially you were taught not to talk about money - it will create a dissociation with money later on. How will your kids ever learn about money and get good at saving and budgeting if it's never talked about? We should think about talking about money as a critical part of our hygiene.

"March 27, 2024",In My House!,121,"  What if you come home and find strangers living in your house? I assumed you order the squatters out, and if they resist, call the police, and they will kick them out. Wrong. Pro-tenant laws passed by anti-capitalist politicians now protect squatters. If a squatter just lies about having a lease, the police won't intervene. ""It's a civil matter,"" they'll say. ""Sort it out in court."" Great. Court might cost $20,000. Or more. And courts are so slow, eviction might take years. In my state, New York, homeowners can't even shut of utilities to try to get the squatter out. That's illegal. Worse, once a squatter has been there 30 days, they are legally considered a tenant. This month, NYC police arrested a homeowner for ""unlawful eviction"" after she changed locks, trying to get rid a squatter. ""Squatter rights,"" also known as ""adverse possession"" laws, now exist in all 50 states. As a result, evicting a squatter legally is so expensive and cumbersome that some people simply walk away from their homes! Flash Shelton may have a better idea. His mom wanted to sell their house after his dad died. But while they were selling it, squatters moved in. Shelton did what I would have done called the police. But the police said there was nothing they could do. So he tried a new tactic: out-squat the squatter. ""I just felt, if they can take a house, I can take a house,"" Shelton says in my new video. ""I could go in as the squatter myself, (and) gain possession of the property."" When the home invader left for a few hours, Shelton went in and changed the locks. Only then did the squatters leave. Now Shelton's started a business, SquatterHunters.com, where he tries to help others get their houses back. ""People think of squatters as homeless, destitute,"" I say. ""They are not homeless,"" answers Shelton. ""They're criminals ... people taking advantage of the system. In fact, one squatter he pushed out was Adam Fleischman, who started the Umami Burger restaurant chain. Fleischman told Shelton, ""I'm a victim here."" He even called the cops. ""He felt that since he had possession of the house,"" says Shelton, ""That he had the right to call law enforcement and have me removed."" I tried to reach Fleischman to hear his side of the story. No luck. ""Where does he hear that he has this right to squat?"" I ask Shelton. ""The city was telling him this,"" says Shelton. But now Shelton was a squatter, too, so he was protected by the same pro-""tenant"" law. Still, only when Shelton threatened to bring friends to the house as backup did Adam Fleischman leave. In Los Angeles, a woman claimed to be a ""caretaker"" for an elderly homeowner, who said she didn't want the woman in her home. So, she gave Shelton a lease. While the squatter was out, Shelton changed the locks. ""But the squatter is still there?"" I ask Shelton. ""Still there,"" he says, ""Climbing through the window because she doesn't have access to the main house."" She's now been there for two years! Shelton says his team will move in and get rid of the squatter. ""How do you know that will work?"" I ask. ""Because once I take possession,"" says Shelton, ""Then she'll have to fight in court to try to get back in. Most likely she won't do that."" Why do squatters feel entitled to other people's property? Probably because people hate landlords. They listen to silly people like Marxist New School professor Miguel Robles-Duran, who calls landlords ""parasites"" who ""provide no social value."" Popular TikTok socialist Madeline Pendleton adds that landlords have ""guaranteed forever incomes, without having to put in any labor."" No labor? Who does she think buys the land; pays lawyers to decipher the excessive regulations; hires architects, carpenters, plumbers and electricians; pays the taxes; manages the property, etc.? It's infuriating! I'm glad people like Flash Shelton fight back. Every Tuesday at JohnStossel.com, Stossel posts a new video about the battle between government and freedom.

"January 11, 2024","Influencer Seeks Dismissal of Libel, Slander Suit on Free Speech Grounds",122,"  LOS ANGELES (CNS) - Attorneys for an influencer sued for libel and slander by a Koreatown plastic surgery and laser treatment center argue in new court papers that the complaint should be dismissed on free-speech grounds, citing the late chef and author Anthony Bourdain as part of their arguments. ""Horrible, horrible place. There's so many places in Koreatown, and Wave is definitely on the list to do not go, and they actually treated me the worst than any place I've walked into,"" defendant Tina Kim said, according to the Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit brought by WAVE Plastic Surgery and Aesthetic Laser Center. But according to court papers filed Tuesday with Judge Maureen Duffy-Lewis, Kim's comments on her TikTok post, a video of 3 minutes, 16 seconds, are protected speech. ""Imagine a world where the late Anthony Bourdain faced a lawsuit for his online criticism and opinion of a cuisine he tried, filed by the owner of the establishment that served the cuisine, freedom of speech would be stifled, and the free flow of information could be hindered due to the fear of having to spend substantial amounts of money defending against such lawsuit,"" Kim's lawyers state in their anti-SLAPP motion. The state's anti-SLAPP -- Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation -- law is intended to prevent people from using courts, and potential threats of a lawsuit, to intimidate those who are exercising their First Amendment rights. The business sued Kim ""simply because plaintiff and its owner, Dr. Peter Lee, did not appreciate what (Kim) had to say about the treatment she received during her visit to plaintiff's facility,"" the anti-SLAPP motion states. According to the suit filed Dec. 7, WAVE ""provides a luxurious environment for patients desiring outstanding outpatient surgery"" and the staff and providers ""strive to provide cutting-edge and state-of-the-art technology and services for patients in the field of aesthetic and anti-aging plastic surgery."" WAVE has industry-leading doctors who specialize in many surgical and non-surgical procedures and has offices in Los Angeles, Costa Mesa, Arcadia, Rowland Heights and San Francisco, according to the suit, which further states that Kim has more than 86,000 TikTok followers and 4.5 million combined likes on all her TikTok posts. The video at issue was posted Nov. 7 by Kim through her public account, @kdramalogic, and is titled ""My review of walking into Wave Plastic Surgery Center in Koreatown L.A."" the suit states. ""I walked in, I walked towards the reception, none of them greeted me,"" Kim said, according to the suit. ""Nothing. Nothing. I walked back up towards the reception area and there (are) three girls there. One is like on the phone. The other one is kinda just talking, and I'm just standing there, and you would think one of the three girls would go, 'Oh, hey, so can I help you, do you have an questions?' Nothing, nothing."" When Kim left the business, she made a disparaging remark to the front desk employees, made a thumbs-down gesture and identified herself as an influencer, the suit states. New customer sign ups have dropped sharply at WAVE since the Kim video's posting, according to the suit, which further alleges Kim intentionally published the video and its false statements with the malicious intent to drive business and customers away from WAVE and toward the plaintiff's competitors. In a sworn declaration in support of her dismissal motion, Kim says she has appeared worldwide as a comedian and that she posts ""various fun and entertaining video reviews on my TikTok page from topics ranging from Korean Pop music, to Kdramas, places to get cheap eats, where to get your haircut, facials and other face work done in Koreatown, where I live, and in Seoul Korea as part my TikTok postings."" Kim says she also often visits plastic surgery facilities in Los Angeles and Korea and posts videos on her TikTok page about her experiences because ""people love knowing about Botox and the latest face laser treatments and facials."" Kim further says she had a previous unpleasant customer service experience with WAVE and decided to give them another chance when she was in the area on Nov. 7 after leaving a bank. ""Wave had no customers inside and it was dead silent when I entered its lobby,"" Kim says. ""When I walked in, there were three individuals sitting behind the front desk. None of these individuals greeted me or even acknowledged my presence. I also found the information they list online about them being a luxury outpatient surgery service, acceptance of walk-ins and the quality in which they treat clients to be far from the truth and misleading."" Kim says she waited for what seemed like 15 minutes to be acknowledged. ""All of them could clearly see me standing there and all three just ignored me as I stood a few feet away,"" Kim says. ""I have never been treated so poorly at any face clinic and as I was at the door, I turned around and told them they're getting a bad review and that I am influencer, to which they still ignored me. They treated me as if I didn't even exist."" Kim says she has received about 670 comments on her video post. A hearing on Kim's dismissal motion is scheduled April 16.

"January 26, 2024",Is Josh Hawley a 'Barbie' Fan?,123,"  MAGA firebrand Josh Hawley is no stranger to political malfeasance - he's the election-denying Missouri senator who famously raised a fist in support of the insurrectionists assembling on the morning of Jan. 6, then was caught on camera a few hours later desperately sprinting from those same rioters as they descended on the Capitol.  But now, shockingly, Hawley is apparently stooping even lower with a dirty tricks campaign aimed at an even more sacred American institution; he appears to be meddling in the Oscar race. Hawley released a Jan. 25 open letter to the Academy demanding that Hollywood help people exposed to radiation during the Manhattan Project by ""telling their stories"" - a dig, perhaps, at Christopher Nolan's Oppenheimer, currently the front runner for Best Picture. ""The Oppenheimer film tells a compelling story of these test programs,"" his letter goes on. ""But it does not tell the story of the Americans left behind - still reckoning with the health and financial consequences of America's nuclear research, after all these years."" It's all a bit puzzling, considering Hawley represents a state that's about a thousand miles from where Robert Oppenheimer set off the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Also, that detonation occurred in 1945, nearly 80 years ago, so presumably there aren't many folks left who were exposed to radiation from the Trinity test (real as the effects were for those who lived in their shadow).  So, what's Hawley really up to? There are two possibilities. The first is that he's attempting to gin up national interest in his surprisingly noble-sounding efforts to win compensation for those harmed by much more recent radiation exposure at a nuclear waste site near St. Louis (last year, Hawley threatened to hold up passage of the national defense policy bill unless the Senate reauthorized the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, due to expire in June).  The second possibility?  He's a huge Barbie fan.

"January 30, 2024",Jenna Bush Hager Is Concerned About Her 10-Year-Old Joining the Ranks of TikTok's Skincare-Obsessed Tweens & She Isn't Alone,124,"  Sephora hauls, get ready with me (GRWM) videos, and other social media content covering all things beauty and skincare is nothing new - but what we aren't accustomed to is tweens sharing their obsession with luxury products, curated 12-step routines, and knowledge of key ingredients in many formulas.  The recent craze among kids is largely attributed to TikTok and other social platforms, and the reach is so wide that even Jenna Bush Hager's daughter - who does not have a smartphone or her own social accounts - is hooked on the concerning phenomenon.  Bush Hager's Experience During Monday's episode of Today with Hoda & Jenna, Bush Hager got candid with her co-host about her 10-year-old's involvement in the pre-teen skincare trend. Hoda Kotb broached the subject, saying ""All these kids who are 12 and younger are apparently obsessed with skincare? USA Today did a story."" TODAY - Pictured: Jenna Bush Hager and Mila Hager on Tuesday, December 20, 2022. Photo by Helen Healey/NBC via Getty Images. After watching a short segment of TikToks shared by tweens, Bush Hager candidly said, ""Let me just go ahead and state this: I have children who are into skincare. They do not have cell phones. They don't even have iPads. So it is happening, it's spreading down ..."" Kotb asked her co-host if she thinks the trend is gaining traction in school, and while it's certainly a hot topic at the lunch table and on the playground (because we're literally talking about third, fourth, and fifth graders here), Bush Hager opined, ""Well, I think it's spreading from TikTok - but it's spreading into the pores of our culture."" A totally valid assessment packaged in a skin-related metaphor - bonus points to the former First Daughter for that pun. ""TikTok 'Sephora haul' videos are all the rage among tweens and teens - here's why I don't want my daughter to be a part of it."" https://t.co/T9U4fvbEwq - SheKnows (@SheKnows) January 27, 2024 The mom of three continued, ""My daughter Mila told me that she went to Target yesterday with a friend. And she goes, 'Look what I bought. This mini Aquaphor, how cute is this?'"" Bush Hager described her reeling reaction, sharing, ""I just thought, 'Where have we come?'""  She continued to explain Mila's disgruntled attitude toward her lukewarm reception. ""She goes, 'Why don't you ever care about that? Why don't you ever care when I tell you the scrub I purchased?' I'm like, 'Mila, because you don't need it. Look at your beautiful skin. You don't need it.'"" The Problem While pre-teens can experience acne and other skin concerns due to early puberty, that isn't where the current craze stems from. These kids are playing with luxury products that look beautiful and seem cool because social media has convinced them that using elite brands and popular potions - and most importantly, telling others about the products - is what will grant them status among their peers.  TODAY - Pictured: Hoda Kotb and Jenna Bush Hager on Monday, November 6, 2023. Photo by Nathan Congleton/NBC via Getty Images. Additionally, the phenomenon is rooted in social media's equally troubling implication that you have to look conventionally beautiful to be worthy. Kids are seeing people on the internet who've garnered status because of their looks, and they're making note of how influencers have attained their beauty - by using fancy products and services that they're all too eager to tell their followers about. Thus, pre-teens believe they too need to be using top-shelf skincare. Meanwhile, the products these kids are experimenting with feature intense ingredients like retinol, AHAs, and vitamin C -ingredients that are intended for adult use only because children don't have concerns like fine lines or hyperpigmentation. Kotb expressed her concern for kids who are dabbling in products that are too mature for them, and how certain strong ingredients can actually damage young skin. Jenna Bush tells us how she prioritizes herself while juggling motherhood, the ways her family influences her own parenting style, and her favorite nutrition hack! Watch the video here. https://t.co/ZNiVqlfGxm - SheKnows (@SheKnows) May 9, 2023 Brooke Jeffy, MD, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of youth skincare brand BTWN, confirmed that Bush Hager, Kotb, and other parents should be concerned about their kids' mounting obsession with skincare. ""Use of inappropriate products that are too harsh for younger skin damages the skin's ability to do its jobs of keeping moisture in, infections out, and protecting us from environmental damage like ultraviolet light exposure,"" Jeffy explained to SheKnows via email. Bush Hager added that her kids aren't racking up three-figure transactions at Sephora like many other tweens, but they are hitting drugstores like CVS and Target to bring home more affordable hauls. Kotb exasperatedly responded, ""But it's also, where are the Barbies? Where is the Nintendo? It's so bizarre to me that their playground is a drugstore where, when we were little, we wanted to go to like, Toys 'R' Us and such,"" she said. See all of the touching ways these mamas are teaching their kids about self-love and self-care! https://t.co/NqlEJWPYZf - SheKnows (@SheKnows) July 23, 2023 Bush Hager again pointed the finger at social media. ""My kids do not have TikTok and they're still into it,"" she shared. ""Their friends get TikTok, which then becomes the fabric of our culture."" On a Positive Note Though Generation Alpha's obsession with skincare is problematic for several reasons, it is encouraging kids to be mindful about taking care of the body's largest organ. The conversation needs to be herded in a healthier, less extreme direction, but there are some positive takeaways parents can use to pivot the discussion.  Get your skincare-obsessed kiddos to focus on establishing a basic skincare routine before puberty is in full swing, emphasizing the use of a gentle cleanser, moisturizer, and SPF. From there, use the topic as grounds for bonding. Have weekly self-care sessions and share your own knowledge of products and ingredients to foster a better understanding of skincare. Do this to ensure when they are ready to graduate to more mature products, they'll be informed buyers who aren't splurging $62 on a moisturizer because it comes in ~aesthetic~ packaging and has a logo that will look, like, really good on their social feeds.

Vogue described this year's ""Garden of Time"" theme as one that has ""nothing to do with the Brothers Grimm or Disney, but is rather a celebration of clothing and fashion so fragile that it can't ever be worn again - and are therefore sleeping beauties in the scrupulously maintained archives of The Costume Institute ... we can expect to see a range of fashion on display, dating back as far as a 17th-century Elizabethan-era English bodice, that embodies the beauty of the natural world - its fragility and its inevitable decay. More modern, less delicate pieces imbued with the same spirit as the spotlit fashions will be showcased alongside them, and broken up into three sub-themes: Land, Sea and Sky."" Vogue also noted the dress code was inspired by a short story of the same name written by JG Ballard in 1962. (Ballard's The Empire of the Sun was adapted into a film by Steven Spielberg.) The Benefit takes place annually on the first Monday in May and marks the opening of The Costume Institute's spring exhibition. To date, the Benefit has raised more than $223.5 million for The Costume Institute under the leadership of Met Trustee Wintour. The 2024 Met Gala will take place on May 6.

"March 8, 2024",Jessica Biel Is Writing a Kids Book About Periods to 'Normalize' Those Awkward Conversations,126,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. Half of all the people in the world menstruate (or have bodies that are/were capable of menstruating), so why is talking about periods with your pre-teen or teen so tricky? Maybe it's because we're starting that conversation too late. A new kids book, written by none other than Jessica Biel, seeks to educate kids from ages 5-9 about periods in a positive and accessible way. Hitting shelves on May 7, A Kids Book About Periods is already a bestseller on Amazon, so clearly parents are ready to be having these conversations. In an interview with People, Biel explained that her motivation to write the book came from wanting to facilitate those talks and make them easier for kids and parents. A Kids Book About Periods by Jessica Biel $19.99 Buy Now On Amazon ""People don't talk enough about periods,"" said Biel, a mom of two. ""I've always felt strongly that we need to normalize the discussion around periods."" As a parent herself, she continued, creating the book was an ""organic way to engage kids in the conversation from early on."" Per People, the book was also made in partnership with PERIOD., a non-profit battling period poverty and stigma, with five percent of proceeds going to the organization. The book itself is ""designed to inspire positive conversations between children and adults"" around menstruation in order to ""empower the next generation,"" according to its description. And it looks like the book will even feature a bit of Biel's own story, per a few sample pages on Amazon. ""Honestly, I wish I knew more about my body when my period started,"" one page states. As Biel says, the idea is to end the stigma around menstruation, a totally normal bodily process. Leading by example is a big part of it, she said in the interview, because if adults ""have the confidence to tell the truth about how our bodies work,"" we can show kids how to talk about their bodies with assurance and agency, a skill that will serve them for the rest of their lives.

(Photo by Leon Bennett/Getty Images) ""Get ready with me while I tell you the secret to being a perfect mom,"" Biel says in the video. She starts by spreading foundation on her face and blending it with a brush. Next, she applies concealer under her eyes - still not saying a word - and fills in her eyebrows. She puts a little lip and cheek color on, then moves on to her eyes, swiping eyeshadow on her lids and curling her lashes. Biel adds a little mascara, then lets her hair down. Once she's ready, she smiles and winks at the camera before the video abruptly cuts off. She never said a word - because there is no secret to being a perfect mom! ""Groundbreaking, I know,"" she captioned the relatable post. It turns out, even celebrities don't have it all figured out, which is honestly such a relief. @jessbiel Groundbreaking, I know. original sound - Jessica Biel ""Hands. Down. The. Best. Advice. Ever.

""God, I mean it's terrifying,"" she continued. ""What's going to happen to these kids? What they have to go through with puberty, it's hard being a kid. I tell my eight-year-old that all the time. I'm like, 'Dude, it's hard being eight. I get it.'"" ""And then I'm gonna help him see that it's hard being 41,"" she added. ""He's just looking at me like, 'What? You don't matter.'""

"February 17, 2024",Joey Graziadei Apologizes for Mixing Up Gypsy Rose Blanchard and Ruth Bader Ginsburg,128,"  Joey Graziadei is clarifying that he definitely knows the difference between Gypsy Rose Blanchard and late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The Bachelor lead's apology came after he accidentally mixed up Blanchard and Ginsburg earlier this month in a Betches video that went viral on TikTok, earning more than 1.6 million views. When shown a photo of Blanchard during a game called ""How Online Are You,"" Graziadei said, ""I do know who this person is. Is it Ruth? No? Is it Jinsburg? Ginsburg? Something like that. Am I wrong?"" Though the reality star mixed up their names, he knew a bit about Blanchard's background, adding, ""I know that she had something happen where she went to jail because of her mom. ... I don't know what I'm saying."" Blanchard was recently released from prison after serving eight years for second-degree murder for the death of her mother, Clauddine ""Dee Dee"" Blanchard. Joey King also portrayed Blanchard in Hulu's limited series The Act. In a video posted on the Bachelor Nation's TikTok Thursday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre teased Graziadei, asking him to identify Ginsburg in a photo since she heard he's ""good with names."" ""I'm so sorry,"" Graziadei said in response. ""It was a bad time. I knew that that wasn't actually her in the photo. Ruth came to my head. I know I won't live that one down. I know how much of a legend she is and how much she's done for, you know, equal rights and women empowerment."" Ginsburg served on the United States Supreme Court for 27 years before she died in 2020 at 87 years old.

"March 4, 2024","John Amos again shuts down neglect allegations, this time amid LAPD investigation",129,"  The daughter of TV starJohn Amos is still issuing a dueling claim about the care of her father and an investigation into those allegations has been opened by the Los Angeles Police Department.  However, the 84-year-old star of ""Good Times"" and the seminal ""Roots"" miniseries has denied recent reports and allegations made by daughter Shannon Amos, who has for months accused her brother Kelly ""K.C."" Amos of neglect and not providing proper care for their father - claims that father and son have disagreed with. Through his longtime spokesperson, the actor told The Times on Monday that he is ""feeling well and working diligently on various projects,"" including a docuseries that he and his son are producing, as well as a music release. ""I'd like to add that everywhere we go together, people refer to my son K.C. as my twin. I'm proud of him for who he is as a person: a caring, thoughtful human being who respects me and I him,"" said the statement, which was first obtained by People. ""Now, I will say this for now: This story about neglect is false and unmerited,"" the statement continued. ""The real truth will come out soon and you will hear it from me. Believe it."" On Monday, the LAPD confirmed to The Times that an elder abuse report was generated on Feb. 8, and that there was an ""open and ongoing investigation"" into the matter.  K.C. and Shannon Amos are the ""Coming to America"" actor's children with ex-wife Noel J. Mickelson. Last summer, Shannon Amos claimed on Instagram that John Amos was ""a victim of elder abuse and financial exploitation"" and said that her father was in the hospital, his life ""hanging by a thread"" - a claim John Amos has repeatedly denied. According to the actor's longtime publicist, John Amos was hospitalized at the time but was recovering after doctors successfully drained some fluid from his lower body. Shannon Amos also alleged that her brother no longer had the authority to make medical decisions for their father. She issued a press release defending herself and speaking out against her brother as the Custer County Sheriff's Office in Colorado continued to investigate allegations of elder abuse. Then, K.C. Amos posted a TikTok of his father saying that before entering the hospital, he ""had some ongoing issues"" with his daughter who he felt ""has taken advantage of me.""  ""She's the one that I would attribute my elderly abuse to,"" he added. However, a rep for Shannon Amos said that John Amos said he ""did not recall any of the statements he previously made regarding the issue."" In July, K.C. Amos was arrested in New Jersey on suspicion of making ""terroristic threats"" against his sister amid the siblings' public dispute. Shannon Amos reported that her brother had threatened to kill her and raised concerns about ""the immediacy of the threat and the likelihood that it would be carried out,"" per a complaint obtained by People. On Sunday, TMZ reported that LAPD officials were looking into allegations of neglect regarding the care of the actor and Shannon Amos' claims, noting that she recently called Adult Protective Services to allege her father was battling health issues and that her brother wasn't getting him proper care. TMZ also reported that the actor was recently hospitalized after a routine check-up, but that Amos confirmed that all was well in a phone call with the outlet. In a Monday statement to The Times, Shannon Amos alleged that Amos' health issues ""have been downplayed despite multiple hospitalizations"" under her brother's care. ""People think this is about money and rivalry ... it is not,"" she said in the statement. ""We went through this before with my Mother, who also suffered tremendous neglect. We are trying to prevent the same thing from happening to my Father. I love my brother and I hope he will get the help he needs, but we need to prioritize the safety of my father who is vulnerable, first and foremost. Anything else can be addressed within our family."" The statement also said that concerns have been raised by caregivers and family, leading to reports to Adult Protective Services.  ""Mr. Amos has been forcibly cut off from all family members, friends, inner circle, and business associates. It is crucial to emphasize that this is not a sibling rivalry, as falsely reported,"" the statement said.  This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"March 18, 2024","John Oliver Mocks Nancy Pelosi's ""Tic-Tac-Toe"" Reference Following House Passage of TikTok Bill",130,"  Nancy Pelosi made a widely derided TikTok pun last week, and John Oliver delighted in joining in chorus of those mocking the former House speaker on HBO's Last Week Tonight. Sunday's episode of the late-night show aired a few days after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill that would lead to a ban of TikTok if its China-based owner doesn't sell its stake. The bill passed on concerns that the app poses a national security threat under the ownership of Chinese technology firm ByteDance Ltd. Lawmakers say the company has ties to the Chinese government, which they fear could demand the company share information that puts the U.S. at risk. (The bill next goes to the Senate.) Describing TikTok as ""the wildly popular app some of you are using to watch this very content in three-minute chunks,"" Oliver introduced a clip of Pelosi explaining the motivation behind the bill. ""This is not an attempt to ban TikTok. It's an attempt to make TikTok better. Tic-tac-toe, a winner. A winner,"" she said, adding hand gestures showing a diagonal win in the Xs and Os game. Mused Oliver: ""I'm curious. Is it a rule that, to be in Congress, you have to be one of the weirdest motherfuckers to ever live?""  He also posited a theory as to how the line in Pelosi's speech got written. ""I would ask how that happened, but I think we all know she went to her speechwriter and said, 'I have the perfect line for the ""TicTac"" vote, and they said, 'Hey, did you just say ""TicTac""?' And she said, 'You're gonna love it,' and they said, 'Again, did you say TicTac? She said, 'It's a winner. It's a winner.'"" And then, Oliver concluded, Pelosi ""marched to the floor and alienated every American under the age of 35."" Meanwhile, Oliver, who is known to take shots at Britain's royal family seemingly every chance he gets, did make a quick reference to the controversy surrounding Kate Middleton's digitally manipulated image that has spawned numerous conspiracy theories. (Oliver himself has talked about the scandal, saying on an episode of Bravo's Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen that he believes ""there is a non-zero chance she died 18 months ago. They might be Weekend at Bernie's-ing this situation."") But on Sunday night, he kept his thoughts brief, saying only that ""a certain someone's Adobe free trial expired in a pretty public manner"" at the top of the show.

"February 13, 2024","Jon Stewart Promptly Rips Trump AND Biden in 'Daily Show' Return: ""Similarly Challenged""",132,"  Jon Stewart returned to host The Daily Show on Monday and within three minutes was already going after Donald Trump - but also Joe Biden, taking a critical look at the president's apparent age-related issues. Announcing ""Indecision 2024: Electile Dysfunction,"" Stewart dove right into the special counsel's report that exonerated President Biden on the matter of mishandling classified documents while also torpedoing his re-election efforts with its description of Biden as an elderly man with a poor memory. Stewart showed clips of Trump being deposed and likewise not being able to recall some basic facts about his life. ""It turns out that the leading cause of early onset dementia is being deposed,"" Stewart says.  But then, Stewart showed footage of Biden's disastrous Friday press conference attempt to assure Americans that he was up to the task of the world's most important job. ""So Joe Biden had a big press conference to dispel the notion that he may have lost a step, politically speaking, and lost three to four steps..."" and then later adds, ""Trump regularly says things at rallies that would warrant a wellness check."" Stewart played Biden's first TikTok video that was launched this weekend and quipped, ""How do you go on TikTok and end up looking older?""""These two candidates, they are both similarly challenged,"" Stewart said. ""And it is not crazy to think that the oldest people in the history of the country to ever run for president might have some of these challenges ... We're not suggesting neither man is vibrant, productive or even capable. But they're both stretching the limits of being able to handle the toughest job in the world. What's crazy is thinking that we're the ones as voters who must silence concerns and criticisms. It is the candidates job to assuage concerns.""Stewart, naturally, did not suggest this meant both candidates were equally flawed, and quickly ran down many concerns about Trump. But, he argued, those were all the more reasons that Trump's opponent needs to be better than Biden. ""Look, Joe Biden isn't Donald Trump,"" he said. ""He hasn't been indicted as many times, hasn't had as many fraudulent businesses or been convicted in a civil trial for sexual assault or been ordered to pay defamation charges or stiffed blue collar tradesman..... The stakes of this election don't make Donald Trump's opponent less subject to scrutiny. It actually makes him more subject to scrutiny. If the barbarians are at the gate, you want Conan [the Barbarian] standing on the ramparts, not chocolate chip cookie guy."" Comedy Central shocked Daily Show fans last month by announcing that Stewart would return to the late-night series as an executive producer and once-a-week host. For non-Monday shows - which Stewart will help steer behind the scenes - The Daily Show will the split host duties among its team of correspondents (which include Jordan Klepper, Desi Lydic, Ronny Chieng, Michael Kosta and Dulcé Sloan).  The move followed the collapse of Stewart's partnership with Apple TV+, where he made the topic-driven discussion series The Problem With Jon Stewart.  Earlier Monday, Stewart explained to CBS Mornings his reason for returning to the show that he previously hosted for 16 years.  ""I very much wanted to have some place to unload thoughts as we get into this election season,"" Stewart said. ""I thought I was going to do it over at ... Apple TV+. ... They decided, they felt that they didn't want me to say things that might get me in trouble. ... I don't know about 'hoping to have an influence,' but I'm hoping to have a catharsis and a way to comment on things and a way to express them that hopefully people will enjoy.""  The re-hiring of Stewart helps shore up The Daily Show during what's bound to be a tumultuous election year. The show's last full-time host, Trevor Noah, unexpectedly stepped down in 2022 after seven years behind the desk.

"February 18, 2024","Jon Stewart returns ""The Daily Show"" to old times. His successor may be a retrofit, too",133,"  Link to Image By every metric that matters - standing ovations, media orgasms and, above all, Nielsen ratings -Jon Stewart'sreturn to ""The Daily Show"" is a smashing success. His first Monday back drew nearly 930,000 viewers in live same-day ratings, the show's biggest audience since March 2018 and the highest-rated in the 25-54 age demographic since 2017. Critics weren't merely overjoyed but relieved to see Stewart slide right back behind the desk as if he never went anywhere. ""Miracle of miracles, Stewart has not lost the ability to be our guy, to act as the collective release valve for anger too studied for stand-up and too frank for news media,"" Charles Bramesco wrote in his review for The Guardian. ""It doesn't matter how many hosts 'The Daily Show' has had. It is Jon's job,"" said W. Kamau Bell in his newsletter. ""Sort of like if Johnny Carson came back from the dead and wanted his job back as host of 'The Tonight Show,' Jimmy Fallon would haaaaaaaaveto step aside."" That is the highest of compliments and possibly true. Carson proved that spending 30 years hosting the same show ensured that everyone who followed him would struggle if not fail to live up to the standard he set. ""The Daily Show"" turns 28 this year, and Stewart served as its host for more than half of its existence. He also left at a drastic turning point in American politics, the news media and the public's relationship with objectivity. And yet, who didn't grin a little when he opened his second series premiere in vintage ""Daily Show"" Stewart fashion with, ""Now, where was I?"" If you are reading this, you have no doubt read that opening line already, or watched it live, along with the highlights of his 20-minute, commercial-free monologue during which he took jabs at the advanced age of both presidential candidates and himself. Pulling his classic ""Meet me at Camera 2"" move, Stewart motioned its operator to zoom in for a close-up, saying ""Look at me. Look what time hath wrought. Give the kids a treat of the lunar surface here. Look at this. I'm, like, 20 years younger than these motherf**kers. "". . . And if you're thinking, 'Oh, well 20 years isn't that long,' this is me 20 years ago,"" he added, pointing to a photo of himself looking downright boyish behind the ""Daily Show"" desk in 2004. The success of Stewart's glorious return after more than eight years away from the host's chair, and following his muted departure from his Apple TV+ show ""The Problem with Jon Stewart,"" was never in question. Every contemplation of ""The Daily Show"" has related its problems to Stewart's exit. Trevor Noah, who was the right host to steer us through Donald Trump's presidency, could never match Stewart in some people's minds. (Nor did he try to.) After he left, most of the celebrity guests who cycled through the show's chair tried to bend the show to their schtick instead of conceding to what its correspondents have long known, which is that Stewart molded its structure and tone.  The best anyone could do was to freshen up the place with a few coats of paint and maybe knock down a half wall to open up the floorplan a little. Once the Monday buzz wore off and we all returned to sobriety, a few folks began to wonder whether Stewart's tried and true strategy of attacking all bad politics was out of fashion. Instead of gunning only for the worst - as in, Trump and the MAGA Republicans - he went after Joe Biden for foregoing the traditional pre-Super Bowl network interview yet again to make his TikTok debut, where he claimed to have a secret fetish for Travis Kelce's mother - her chocolate chip cookies, specifically. ""Fire everyone. Everyone,"" Stewart deadpanned after the damning clip played. ""How do you go on TikTok and end up looking older? This swipe has a touch of ""Physician, heal thyself"" to it, which Stewart and ""The Daily Show"" acknowledge in the segments that followed Stewart reintroducing the show's longstanding correspondents. Michael Kosta, Desi Lydic and Ronny Chieng pretended to be posted up inside a diner, with Dulc Sloan fake reporting from its parking lot, a vantage from which she observed, ""This is the same s**t all over again. It's just a reboot! We need more than just the same show with an older yet familiar face . . . They already had this job."" Ha! Because, see, she might not be talking about Trump and Biden, right? ""Now these old white dudes gotta come back and reclaim it? Like, come on, sir,"" Sloan continued. ""Go do something new. It's so desperate. Like, let someone else run the show."" We all get the joke. Just when we thought ""The Daily Show"" was ready to do the serious work of rebranding to fit the times, it went with a rewind. Why not? Vinyl LPs are in again. Plus, with so much of the nation set on rolling back hard-earned sociopolitical gains, maybe the person who woke up Gen X and elder Millennials to prior administrations' outrages is the right one to reactivate them now. If Stewart seems angrier and more combative now than he was in the past . . . well, aren't we all? And as I recall his surliness at the height of the George W. Bush years, from whence that 20-years-ago photo he showed was exhumed, I'm not sure he's changed all that much. Some have posited this will be the fatal flaw in this experiment. Stewart might not have budged from his consensus that one side of the aisle isn't much purer than the other, but some progressives expected ""our guy"" to play along with that tune. Can you blame them? The clips of ""our guy"" playing in the latest ""Daily Show"" ads are nearly a decade old. Politics moved differently then. But let's slide that stew to the backburner and pose a question Stewart raised, only to address the show's strategy for the next nine months: What the f**k are we doing here, people?  To remove all doubt: Stewart's first night back was highly enjoyable. His jabs at the geriatric status of the candidates topping both sides of the ticket were dead center. So what if he pulled most of his jokes from headlines other late-night hosts digested some time ago? Chalk that up to him establishing his second administration's platform, letting us know that he didn't intend to let Biden's sins slide, regardless of how repugnant the alternative may be. But less attention was paid to the show's first selection to fill the ""Daily Show"" host chair on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday: Jordan Klepper. Link to ImageKlepper is astute and capable, one of the two current ""Daily Show"" contributors who is a holdover from Stewart's reign. The other, Lewis Black, predates Stewart. He'll get his turn behind the desk soon, Comedy Central assured us in a press release. Neither is a full-time correspondent, which hints at how producers may be thinking about the best way for Stewart to hand the reins to an eventual successor. Sliding Klepper into the slots following Stewart's first week back gives Klepper the best odds of riding the Great One's ratings spike, along with granting the show something of a bulwark against rating erosion. Theoretically.  A recent Variety story gauged the success of Stewart's Mondays-only strategy by likening it to what MSNBC has with Rachel Maddow, another once-a-week talent and the network's biggest star. But it found that the ratings bump Maddow produces on Mondays doesn't carry through the Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday telecasts in the same timeslot. That may have something to do with other personalities' inability to duplicate Maddow's singular appeal. Stewart, though, has time to persuade his faithful to accept whoever is chosen to take over as a full time host. He's signed on as an executive producer along with his manager James Dixon through 2025, making these the earliest of early days in this part of a process that's already dragged on for too long. Want a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course. Behind all the applause and celebration of the conqueror's return, the truth is we're still witnessing the celebrity hosting phase of ""The Daily Show."" Said celebrity simply happened to find himself suddenly unemployed, yet still very popular with his base. (And wealthy.) He's the temporary winner in a contest that might have ended if the show decided to take a chance with in-house favorites Desi Lydic or former correspondent Roy Wood Jr. But Klepper is not entirely inside the building either. He had a weekly ""Daily Show"" spinofffor a short time, then helmed a docuseries. During Noah's era, Klepper dropped regular field reports from Trump rallies where he displayed masterful crowd work skills by tangling the MAGA faithful in their webs of ignorance. Behind the desk, Klepper deftly juggles both the show's signature fake news snark and the standard host's avuncularity. He's also another white guy in long late-night parade of white men. Circling back to Bell likening Stewart's GOAT status to that of Johnny Carson, let's not forget that Carson: a) has been very dead for longer than the nation's 18-year-old voters and comedy consumers have been alive, and b) was 66 years old when he retired. That's five years older than Stewart is right now. Future weeks of Stewart Mondays and TBD hosts at the helm for the rest of the week will likely produce some pattern that may inform the direction of ""The Daily Show.""  But if the show's own Indecision 2023 and the raging success of Indecision 2024's nascent stages tell us anything, it's that we may be too entrenched in the familiar to allow it to fully reinvent itself and plunge into the future with someone new. Counterpoint: who cares? Jon Stewart is back - big time! It's like he never left. Perhaps he never will.

"January 20, 2024",Josh Hutcherson Reveals He Lost Out on 'Home Alone' Role,134,"  Josh Hutcherson has starred in some memorable projects since starting in the industry as a child, but there's one role he lost out on that might surprise fans. During a recent interview withBuzzFeed, the actor revealed he auditioned for one of the Home Alone films when he was younger. ""I was probably 11, I think, when I auditioned for it,"" the Five Nights at Freddy's actor recalled. ""It got down to me and the other guy. That was the first time that I tasted rejection, so that was really hard.""  Though Hutcherson didn't share what installment in the Home Alone franchise he auditioned for, based on the timeline, it would have been one of the newer films. Since the first two movies that Macaulay Culkin is most known for were released in 1990 and 1992, right around when Hutcherson was born.  As for the other installments, Alex D. Linz starred in 1997's Home Alone 3, Mike Weinberg led 2002's Home Alone 4, Christian Martyn starred in 2012's Home Alone: The Holiday Heist and Archie Yates led 2021's Home Sweet Home Alone. Hutcherson went on to score roles in several other projects as a child, including RV, Bridge to Terabithia, Journey to the Center of the Earth and more. He also reached a new level of fame with his role as Peeta in the Hunger Games franchise. Elsewhere in the interview, when asked if he still keeps in touch with his Hunger Games co-stars Jennifer Lawrence and Liam Hemsworth, he said they still find time to get together despite their busy work schedules. ""They're still near and dear to me,"" The Beekeeper actor added. He also later noted that he ""would go back to Peeta in a heartbeat,"" and relive the ""whole Hunger Games experience again"" if he could.

"March 22, 2024","Josh Peck Breaks Silence About Drake Bell Revelations in 'Quiet on Set': ""Children Should Be Protected""",135,"  Josh Peck has broken his silence on Investigation Discovery's Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV docuseries, which put his Drake & Josh co-star Drake Bell in the spotlight. The actor-musician revealed he had been sexually abused as a child by his dialogue coach while working at Nickelodeon. ""I finished the Quiet On Set documentary and took a few days to process it,"" Josh Peck's Instagram post began. ""I reached out to Drake privately, but wanted to give my support for the survivors who were brave enough to share their stories of emotional and physical abuse on Nickelodeon sets with the world."" He continued, ""Children should be protected. Reliving this publicly is incredibly difficult, but I hope it can bring healing for the victims and their families as well as necessary change to our industry.""  Josh Peck's statement comes the day after Bell asked his fans, who were slamming the Oppenheimer actor for not speaking up on behalf of his co-star, to ""take it a little easy on him."" He added that Josh Peck had already reached out to him personally to express his support.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Josh Peck (@shuapeck) ""It's been very sensitive, but he has reached out to talk with me and help me work through this and has been really, really great,"" Bell shared in a TikTok. ""So I just wanted to let you guys know that and to take it a little easy on him."" On Drake & Josh, the actors played stepbrothers, whose separate families became one when Drake and Megan's (Miranda Cosgrove) mom, Audrey (Nancy Sullivan), married Josh's dad, Walter (Jonathan Goldstein). Following the docuseries' release, Sullivan shared a sweet message of support for Bell. ""They weren't my real kids, but I'll always love them,"" she captioned a photo of her onscreen son. ""It broke my heart into a million pieces to hear just how much Drake was holding inside while we were working together. I was both devastated and proud seeing the man he's grown into sit down on camera and bravely tell his truth."" Her post continued, ""Past abuse doesn't define us, and it has no right to rule our lives, I know that putting this burden down will free him in so many ways. I hope memories of the joy he had on our shows will someday greatly overshadow the pain. Sending love to Drake for a deep healing and for a rich and beautiful life ahead."" Josh Peck previously opened up about how he and Bell sort of drifted apart following the end of Drake & Josh. During an appearance on BFFs With Dave Portnoy, Josh Richards and Brianna Chickenfry in March 2022, the actor noted they weren't friends anymore.  ""We were kids, right? Obviously, there were times when we were closer than not, but when inevitably the show ended - I mean, we're just totally different kids,"" he said at the time. ""Drake & Josh is something I'll be synonymous with forever, and I'm proud of it. And I want to like the guy that my name is attached to forever, but unfortunately, it just sort of worked out the way that it did."" In the four-part ID docuseries, Bell shared his story of child sexual abuse when he was 15, at the hands of his former dialogue coach, Brian Peck (who is not related to Josh Peck). In 2003, Brian Peck was accused of molesting a child. He was subsequently convicted of a lewd act against a child and oral copulation of a person under 16, and spent 16 months in prison. Only now do we learn Bell, then a minor at 15 years of age and the star of Nickelodeon shows like All That and The Amanda Show, was at the center of that criminal case and conviction. The actor-musician is one of multiple child stars who were on Nickelodeon and came forward in Quiet on Set with allegations of abuse, sexism, racism and inappropriate behavior surrounding shows led by Dan Schneider in the early 2000s. Those series include The Amanda Show, Drake & Josh, Zoey 101, iCarly, Victorious and Sam & Cat. Victorious star Matt Bennett, who played Robbie on the show that starred Victoria Justice, shared a lengthy statement on his Instagram Story, which has now expired. In his post, he explained that he had been reflecting on the docuseries since watching it.  ""I spent most of it trying to remove myself from the situation, asking, 'If I hadn't worked for Nickelodeon and didn't know any of the people involved, would I be ok with the behavior and the treatment of others I'm seeing?' And the answer is no. I wouldn't be ok with it and I'm not ok with it. I'm not sure how much I can do or say today, it's all a little too real for me right now.""  He continued, ""There are some mental pretzels I have to work on undoing but over the next few weeks, months and years I'm dedicated to help in any way I can to put more safeguards in place to protect young actors. Entertainment is important but it's not as important as the mental and physical health of the people creating it, especially those who aren't in a position to speak up for themselves.""  Schneider has broken his silenceafter watching the docuseries, noting that it forced him to face his past behaviors and that he regrets some of them.  ""When I watched the show, I could see the hurt in some people's eyes, and it made me feel awful and regretful and sorry,"" he said in a video exclusively obtained by The Hollywood Reporter. ""I wish I could go back, especially to those earlier years of my career, and bring the growth and the experience that I have now and just do a better job and never, ever feel like it was OK to be an asshole to anyone, ever.""

"March 22, 2024",Josh Peck speaks out after documentary details Drake Bell's abuse by TV coach,136,"  Josh Peck has spoken out after the release of a documentary detailing the abuse his ""Drake & Josh"" co-star Drake Bell suffered at the hands of a Nickelodeon dialogue coach. ""Quiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV,"" a four-part docuseries released this week by Investigation Discovery, pieces together testimonies from former Nickelodeon cast and crew members, court documents and archival footage to reveal the dark underbelly of the children's channel. Peck, who most recently appeared in the 2024 best picture winner ""Oppenheimer,"" posted Thursday on social media about his emotional experience watching the documentary.  ""I finished the Quiet on Set documentary and took a few days to process it,"" Peck wrote on Instagram. ""I reached out to Drake privately, but wanted to give my support for the survivors who were brave enough to share their stories of emotional and physical abuse on Nickelodeon sets with the world."" He continued, ""Children should be protected. Reliving this publicly is incredibly difficult, but I hope it can bring healing for the victims and their families as well as necessary change to our industry."" Peck's statement comes after his former co-star defended him to fans who criticized his perceived silence.  ""Processing this and going through this is a really emotional time,"" Bell said on TikTok. ""It's been very sensitive, but [Peck] has reached out to talk with me and help me work through this and has been really, really great. So I just wanted to let you guys know that and to take it a little easy on him."" Bell's account is among the documentary's grisliest - centered on his reportedly months-long sexual abuse by Brian Peck, who worked as a dialogue coach on several Nickelodeon series featuring Bell and was arrested by Los Angeles police in August 2003 for ""lewd acts with a child."" (Brian Peck and Josh Peck are not related.) Brian Peck was convicted after pleading no contest in May 2004 to two of 11 charges of child sex abuse. He served 16 months in prison and was required to register as a sex offender. After serving his sentence, he was hired as an actor on three episodes of the Disney Channel's ""The Suite Life of Zack & Cody."" In the documentary, Bell recalls being taken aback by the unwavering support so many industry executives showed for Brian Peck. ""His entire side of the courtroom was full,"" Bell said. ""There were definitely some recognizable faces on that side of the room. And my side was me, my mom and my brother."" In a Tuesday video response to the documentary, Dan Schneider, who is at the center of several abuse allegations from former stars of his shows, teared up as he recalled helping Bell's mother compose her testimony against Brian Peck. ""That was probably the darkest part of my career,"" he said. Nickelodeon also released its own statement to NBC Wednesday. ""Though we cannot corroborate or negate allegations of behaviors from productions decades ago, Nickelodeon as a matter of policy investigates all formal complaints as part of our commitment to fostering a safe and professional workplace environment free of harassment or other kinds of inappropriate conduct,"" the statement said.  ""Our highest priorities are the well-being and best interests not just of our employees, casts and crew, but of all children, and we have adopted numerous safeguards over the years to help ensure we are living up to our own high standards and the expectations of our audience.""

"February 28, 2024",Joy Reid's Tacky TikTok Talk,137,"  In case you just can't get enough of Joy Reid for an hour each weeknight on MSNBC, you can catch her sharing her wild and loose opinions on TikTok. Recently, she pounced on remarks by Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) supporting the Alabama court decision that frozen embryos are children, because ""we need more kids."" Our fertility rate in America is now at a record low, but Reid just wants to use Alabama's football coach senator as a punching bag. ""Why does the state of Alabama need more kids? More kids for what?"" Reid wants to make this about immigration. ""Your party, Sen. Tuberville, is the one screaming that 10 million immigrants ... have streamed into the country since Joe Biden has been president. And you're claiming that's too many people."" Most critics of the border crisis aren't arguing that America is overpopulated. They're arguing the massive influx of humanity is too much for our government systems to handle, which is the same critique emanating from Democrat big-city mayors who have been swamped with migrants who expect free food, housing and maybe a monthly gift card. But Reid was primed to uncork a racial conspiracy theory, which MSNBC always encourages against Republicans. Antebellum references seem mandatory. ""There was a time when the state of Alabama absolutely needed more kids, because Alabama was a slave state,"" Reid proclaimed, ""and the mandate of the planter class in Alabama was for black women to produce more kids because those kids were property, and they could work more kids and make more money on their plantation."" But what does 1854 have to do with 2024? Reid suggested there was a master plan: ""Are you saying the state of Alabama needs more kids because you think that those populations will include people who may be destitute and desperate enough that when you kick out the immigrants ... you can make them do the work that the migrants are doing now? 'Cause that kind of sounds slavery-ish."" Wait. If the immigrants flooding into America are doing ""slavery-ish"" work, shouldn't Reid oppose more immigration? Reid needs to imply the immigrants pouring in are ""people of color,"" even if that's not true. For the Left, appeals to limit illegal immigration must always be painted as motivated by racism. To its credit, The New York Times has published a series of investigative reports on migrant child labor in America. One was headlined ""Alone and Exploited, Migrant Children Work Brutal Jobs Across the U.S."" No one imagines that led to a scathing TikTok tirade by Reid. She closed out by asking Tuberville in absentia if, since he's a ""white guy,"" he's suggesting ""we need more kids"" means ""whites need more kids,"" a ""Great Replacement thing,"" because if he thinks white women need to make more babies, ""that's a little creepy. A little 'Handmaid's Tale,' don't you think?"" Back in 2021, Reid took to TikTok to mock Kyle Rittenhouse for tearing up when he testified about shooting rioters dead in self-defense. Reid compared him to Justice Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearings, mocking their ""male white tears,"" and proclaiming these guys ""Karen-out, and as soon as they get caught, they bring waterworks."" Reid wouldn't use this white-Karens-waterworks mockery for Hillary Clinton's public tears when she ran for president. These videos aren't for everyone. They're for the hardcore MSNBC watchers who want to ""own the cons,"" but especially those stale pale males. Conservatives just want to check what chemicals she might have put in her vape pen to explain that overactive imagination.

"March 23, 2024","Judd Apatow on Why It's ""Scary"" Netflix Can License HBO Shows: ""Cheaper Than Making New Ones""",138,"  Judd Apatow is opening up about the current state of television and why he finds it ""scary"" that Netflix can license shows from HBO. The writer-director-producer told Vulture in a recent interview that licensing pacts between streaming giants is just going to lead to viewers getting ""fewer new shows."" ""I'm of two minds,"" Apatow explained. ""There's a part of me that's an audience member: I'll go back and rewatch Deadwood or NYPD Blue or any of the David Milch shows. I understand why people like the comfort food of television."" The This Is 40 writer-director continued, ""But it's a scary thing as a creator of television, because of all the streamers going, 'Wait a second. We don't need to spend $200 million on a new show. We can just bring back Barnaby Jones.' They're going to do it, then you'll get fewer new shows. They realize, 'Oh wait, Netflix can just buy shows from HBO,' and I would assume they're cheaper than making new ones. Then at some point, Netflix will sell its shows to HBO, and it'll just be passing around all the episodes of Ballers for the rest of our lives."" Last year, it was revealed that several Warner Bros. Discovery-owned titles, including Insecure and Sex and the City, would be available on Netflix, the rival streaming platform in the U.S. It was part of a co-exclusive deal with WBD's streamer Max. Apatow also shared his thoughts with Vulture on the future of Hollywood, particularly within the TV medium. ""There are these corporate behemoths and people from the tech world taking over creativity. And for some of them - not all of them - their intentions are just eyeball time online,"" the Girls writer-producer said. ""I don't know if they're obsessed with quality filmmaking in the way other owners of these entities have been in the past. That's why they started calling it 'content.' All of a sudden, they diminished it as much as it possibly could be. I don't think it would be that weird if you read something in the paper that Pornhub bought Paramount+."" But Apatow later stressed the importance of taking risks in filmmaking, using Universal's Donna Langley as an example when she took a bet on Oscar-winning Oppenheimer. However, he acknowledged that the industry typically likes to play ""follow the leader."" ""Here's the thing that most people don't understand because they're not in any of those executive suites: There's a hit and then they just go, 'Oh, people like that. Make more like that.' The thinking is not deeper than that,"" the 40-Year-Old Virgin director-writer added. ""They will just chase anything that does well, because people generally are averse to risk taking.""

"February 14, 2024",Kate Hudson Still Receives 10-Cent Residual Checks for 'Home Alone 2',140,"  Residuals aren't what they used to be, apparently even if you're A-list talent.  That's what Kate Hudson revealed on her Sibling Revelry podcast on Monday while speaking about the minuscule checks she receives from her brief appearance as a child in the hit sequel Home Alone 2: Lost in New York. Hudson asked her guest, fellow actor Joey Lawrence, about being paid for his work in commercials as a child. ""I still get residuals from Home Alone 2 because I sang in the chorus,"" the Glass Onion star revealed. ""I'm in that chorus, and then I get 10 cents every once in a while."" Hudson, 44, was a preteen when she filmed the brief, very early career cameo for the Christmas comedy, which follows the McCallister family on a trip to New York. In the scene in question, her little-known appearance comes as a member of a holiday chorus alongside several of the McCallister kids. On the podcast - which Hudson hosts with her brother, actor Oliver Hudson; Lawrence; and his brothers, Matthew and Andy - said they had no idea that she was in the '90s classic starring Macaulay Culkin. Joey Lawrence, 47, who got his big break on the hit sitcoms Gimmie a Break and Blossom, told the hosts of a similar experience regarding payments for the dozens of ads in which he appeared as a child. ""Sometimes I'll get, like, 2 cents. And I'm like, 'Wait. Doesn't the envelope and paper cost more?'"" he joked.  ""At least they're being fair and honest,"" Kate replied, referring to the companies that pay out the residuals - the long-term payments to actors, writers and others who work on movies and TV series each time a show runs on television. Residual payments werea major sticking point during the recent actors and writers strikes. Traditionally pegged to factors including the size of a role, production budget and where the movie or series is now airing, the shift to streaming - where viewership numbers are kept secret - made residual payments a fraction of what they once were. During the strike, actors shared examples of this decline. Orange Is the New Black's Kimiko Glenn made a TikTok video that showed a mere $27 for foreign residuals. Residuals are supposed to land in mailboxes one to four months after air, and amounts are calculated and administered by unions like SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America.

"March 19, 2024",Kate Middleton Health Rumors Continue Despite Video Footage as Second Image Is Deemed Altered,142,"  An apparently happy and healthy-looking Kate Middleton was seen walking alongside her husband, Prince William, near Windsor Castle in video footage reportedly shot over the weekend. The video is helping to dispel one of this year's most enduring conspiracy theories regarding her health and whereabouts while recovering from abdominal surgery - though skepticism still abounds, as the Palace has yet to verify or comment on the video. And now speculation around the royal has moved to a second image she shared in 2022 that on Tuesday was deemed to have been altered.  The video was shot on Saturday about a mile outside of Windsor, England, and has been verified by TMZ, which posted the clip online on Monday. The Middleton sighting had initially been reported over the weekend, without the footage, and the new clip seemingly verifies those reports; TMZ stated that it verified that footage metadata. Middleton is seen in good spirits, smiling and casually shopping with William at the Windsor Farm Shop near the couple's Adelaide Cottage home. ""Kate was out shopping with William and she looked happy and she looked well,"" an unnamed eyewitness told U.K. tabloid The Sun. ""The kids weren't with them but it's such a good sign she was healthy enough to pop down to the shops."" The red-top paper reports that Middleton, who had not been seen publicly since Christmas, spent part of Saturday morning watching their three children George, Charlotte and Louis play sports. Rumors and conspiracy theories about Middleton's whereabouts amid her recovery from a Jan. 17 surgery grew as users on TikTok and other social media platforms questioned the official word coming from Kensington Palace. Speculation zeroed in on the vagueness around the nature of the Princess of Wales' scheduled but announced-at-the-last-minute abdominal surgery; the planned length of her recovery, which included 10 days in The London Clinic followed by home rest, which the palace announced would keep her from royal duties until Easter; and Prince William's late February cancellation of a scheduled appearance at a Windsor Castle memorial service for his godfather.  Kensington Palace had announced that the princess was discharged from the London Clinic on Jan. 29 and was doing well. As speculation ballooned, on Feb. 29, palace officials felt compelled to repeat that news on her health would come if there was anything significant to be said. But that did little to quell the growing speculation around Middleton, and the next evidence to emerge - a grainy image of the princess in a car with her mother - fueled the fire. ""The strangest thing about it is that Kate is so punctilious about her own image ... so the mess of this picture is a curious thing,"" royals expert and Daily Beast founder Tina Brown said on CBS Mornings, referring to what she called a ""jigsaw"" of multiple other images. Rumors turned to headline news when a not-so-slick attempt to dispel any questions backfired. On March 10, Britain's Mother's Day, Kensington Palace shared a photo, purported to have been taken by Prince William, of his smiling family, with Middleton at the center. But photo agencies quickly deemed the picture manipulated and it was yanked from four news wire services. In a rare occurrence,the princess issued a mea culpafor the altered image, which had undergone 17 edits. ""Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing,"" Middleton wrote on the royal couple's X account, signing it with a ""C"" for Catherine. ""I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother's Day."" Like many amateur photographers, I do occasionally experiment with editing. I wanted to express my apologies for any confusion the family photograph we shared yesterday caused. I hope everyone celebrating had a very happy Mother's Day. C - The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) March 11, 2024 With this, mainstream media began to follow the lead of social media royal watchers, as both exploded with stories about the couple's photo snafu and theorists pontificated about not only the health of the princess but that of the future king and queen's marriage. What did this say about the royals and their control of social media vis-a-vis tabloid news, one New York Times columnist asked, while another saw a double standardbetween the treatment of Middleton and her sister-in-law, Meghan Markle.  ""Katespiracy"" rumors came quickly, too, with TikTok users amplifying whispers around Rose Hanbury, a friend in the couple's inner circle and whose grandmother was one of the bridesmaids at the wedding of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip in 1947. Though she's been married to David Rocksavage, 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley, since 2009, unsubstantiated rumors about an affair with William have been called an open secret for years. This week, Hanbury said through her attorneys that these rumors are ""completely false,"" according to Business Insider.  Rose Hanbury, Marchioness of Cholmondeley, departing Westminster Abbey after the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla on May 6, 2023 in London.  While the video footage from the weekend could effectively shut down rumors about Middleton's health, she now faces renewed scrutiny in the press. On Tuesday, an image she shared in April 2023 was deemed by Getty Images to have been manipulated. The portrait of the late Queen Elizabeth with her grandchildren and great-grandchildren, taken by the princess on a trip to Balmoral Castle in Scotland in 2022, was released by Buckingham Palace on what would have been the late monarch's 97th birthday. ""Getty Images has reviewed the image in question and placed an editor's note on it, stating that the image has been digitally enhanced at source,"" a spokesperson for the wire service told British broadsheet The Telegraph. View this post on Instagram A post shared by The Prince and Princess of Wales (@princeandprincessofwales) Royal officials have not commented on the image, but on Tuesday, Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer repeated the call for respect as Middleton recovers while appearing on British talk radio station LBC.  ""She is a remarkable lady and I think we should give her a little bit of privacy,"" she said.

"March 5, 2024",Kate Middleton's First Sighting After Surgery Only Fuels the Conspiracy Theories Even More,143,"  The royal family probably thought it was a great idea to get a snapshot of Kate Middleton out there to the public, who has been tweeting away furiously with the hashtag #WhereIsKate. In theory, it's a great idea: here's the Princess of Wales, she's recovering, her mom Carole Middleton is taking care of her, and everyone moves on. Well, as we mentioned before, the PR handling of this situation has been messy, and the palace let the narrative of her health crisis get way ahead of them.  The grainy photo of Kate didn't exactly look like the highly polished princess that royal fans are accustomed to. (Do any of us look good when we are sick or not feeling our best? No!) Some social media users didn't think it looked like her at all - and that's when the conspiracy theories started sparking on X, formerly Twitter, yet again. The image might have had the opposite effect of what the royal family had been hoping for, even though ABC News reported that ""the photograph was not released or authorized by Kensington Palace."" According to Katie Couric Media, British tabloids largely avoided publishing the seemingly unauthorized photo, only fuelling reports that it wasn't Kate.  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM - DECEMBER 18: Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge attend a Christmas lunch for members of the Royal Family hosted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on December 18, 2019 in London, England.  However, it's hard not to spot the photo credit that listed Backgrid, a news agency that often works with celebrities to shoot planned paparazzi photoshoots. People are savvy these days and it's hard to pull a fast one over eagle-eyed fans, but some of the latest theories are over-the-top. ""girl that ain't kate middleton.... that's some unknown,"" wroteone skeptical account on X. Another believes the woman sitting next to Carole in the passenger seat is her younger sister, Pippa. ""Pippa girl, is that you?Is this the double I was talking about?

""Now, this picture is so funny to me because the car paparazzi shot is Kate Middleton's go-to move when she wants to be seen, but not answer any questions,"" she explained on her account. Matta then goes on to point out driving snapshots of the Princess of Wales ""looking stoic"" after Prince Harry's Spare was published, after Harry and Meghan Markle's Oprah Winfrey interview, and after Queen Elizabeth II passed for the perfect ""somber"" shot.  ""And I say 'gave' paparazzi this shot because we've seen over the past two months that it is possible to hide, to remain private if you want to as a royal,"" Matta concluded. So, while the conspiracy theories are wild - this snapshot is totally from the Kate playbook. She's giving everyone the photo that they want, even if it's only fueling the fire even more.

"March 25, 2024","Kim Gordon never fully said 'Bye Bye' to L.A. Why she's back, with a TikTok hit to boot",144,"  For Kim Gordon, returning to Los Angeles was once her least likely destiny.  She largely grew up here, and as an aspiring young artist, she'd been desperate to escape SoCal suburbia and the commercial imperative she felt in Los Angeles. So she left for Manhattan, inspired by the examples of Merce Cunningham and Robert Rauschenberg, of the scene at Andy Warhol's Factory and the Judson dance collective. In New York, she thrived as a painter, an underground style icon and, most famously, as a member of the influential noise-rock band Sonic Youth. ""I also felt like L.A. was just a town about money,"" recalls Gordon, who now lives in the hills of Los Feliz. ""At some point, it switched. It was maybe 2008, and somehow L.A. started looking more quaint. And New York became what it has really always been, which is about money."" Ever since Sonic Youth ended in 2011, along with her marriage to band co-founder Thurston Moore, Gordon has embraced a diverse flurry of projects. She's put renewed focus on her gallery work and embarked on a series of collaborations, including the experimental guitar duo Body/Head with Bill Nace. She has performed live improvisations at L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art, the Louvre in Paris and elsewhere with choreographer Dimitri Chamblas, who interacts with Gordon as she unleashes driving patterns of distortion on guitar. At age 70, she is two albums into a vibrant solo music career. On March 8, she released ""The Collective,"" an uncompromising blend of noise and melody, bursts of avant-garde guitar and underground hip-hop. It's a sound that makes sense in the context of her long career but without sounding like an echo from her past. The album's 11 songs are defiantly of the moment and a direct result of her return to L.A. On a recent rainy afternoon, Gordon steps into a coffeehouse on Hillhurst Avenue, looking much as she has since the early '90s, in a shiny black raincoat, her straight blond hair cropped into a crisp bob. It's her third interview of the day as she prepares for an upcoming solo tour set to land at L.A.'s Regent Theater on Wednesday. ""It's exciting. It's a little nerve-wracking. I have to memorize all those lyrics,"" she says with a laugh. In Los Angeles, she's found a key collaborator in producer and co-writer Justin Raisen, who recorded her solo albums at his home studio in Glassell Park, starting with ""No Home Record"" in 2019. A modernist with a taste for the raw and unpredictable, Raisen has recently worked with artists who stretch from Lil Yachty and Kid Cudi to John Cale and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. ""I actually never really intended to make a solo record,"" Gordon says with a smile. ""I accidentally met Justin Raisen, and he kept bugging me to make a record. After we initially made something together, I was like, 'OK, I like his sensibility.'"" Her first track with Raisen was ""Murdered Out,"" a 2019 electronic beat of anxious foreboding with Gordon's voice on edge warning: ""Murdered out of my heart/Covered in black matte spray/Will you see when I'm not there?"" ""The thing about collaborations is somehow, when they're working, they give you a certain confidence to really reach for ideas and take risks that maybe you wouldn't on your own,"" Gordon says. Her interest in hip-hop stretches back at least to her first time hearing LL Cool J's debut album, ""Radio,"" in 1985, and its influence was sometimes felt in her work with Sonic Youth. She was joined by Public Enemy's Chuck D on the band's song ""Kool Thing,"" and in 1993 Sonic Youth, recorded the woozy ""I Love You Mary Jane"" with Cypress Hill for the hugely influential rap-rock movie soundtrack from ""Judgment Night."" She also mingled beats and noise in a 2000 collaboration with Ikue Mori and DJ Olive that Sonic Youth released on its SYR indie label. The new songs are part of that same lineage.  ""The reason it sounds relevant and still her is because she's more open to danger and taking chances than new popular artists,"" Raisen says later. ""She's willing to take those chances, and she's willing to question."" The title of ""The Collective"" is an idea inspired by ""The Candy House,"" a novel by Jennifer Egan that describes the human impact of an app that allows users to plug into the experiences and memories of anyone who uploads into the collective and a mysterious company called Mandala. ""The catch is you have to upload your own memories and experiences in order to be part of the access that's making yourself vulnerable,"" Gordon says. ""I thought it was sort of close to where we are now already in technology. The record, to me, feels a little sci-fi in a sense."" On the cover is a blurry image of a hand holding a phone photographed by musician Twig Harper. It was shot at a Body/Head show last year at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills. ""I guess when you play live with an audience, we do become kind of a collective, whether you like it or not,"" she says. ""It's part of this experience."" The album opens with "" Bye Bye,"" a track of swirling, ominous tension, as tough beats collide with grinding bursts of her guitar. The effect is gorgeously imperfect as her vocal then rattles off an otherwise mundane packing list, her delivery detached yet quietly obsessed: ""Hoodie, toothpaste, brush, foundation/Contact solution, mascara, lip mask, eye mask/Ear plugs, travel shampoo, con-di-tion-er ..."" ""It was such a compelling beat, and I thought it'd be cool to contrast it with something really banal like a to-do packing list,"" she says with a laugh. ""I'm limited as a singer, so there are things that I'm aware of that I can do using space. It's weird. When I have the right tone in my earphones - with an effect or something - it gives me a certain confidence. It's like I transform into another person."" That unconventional vocal style was established during her time in Sonic Youth, where it fit easily amid the band's dissonant noise rock, even as it occasionally reached MTV and the '90s commercial airwaves in the form of ""Kool Thing"" and ""Bull in the Heather."" Gordon's spoken vocals are as much avant-garde as they are directly inspired by the speaking-vocal style of the '60s girl group the Shangri-Las. But it's been a new discovery for at least some younger listeners astonished by what they are hearing in "" Bye Bye,"" the new album's first single. With the song's January release, Gordon unexpectedly became a TikTok sensation, as both longtime fans and young women discovering her for the first time posted videos of themselves lip-syncing to the song's shopping list lyrics or just listening. One young woman in headphones posted how she'll ""Never have to make another packing list again,"" as she's seen on-camera shoving items from the lyrics into a backpack. A red-haired woman with a cartoon mouse tattoo on her bicep posted: ""I think Kim Gordon just cured my fear of aging."" Another young listener in Poland just nods her head to the beat, and writes: ""Byc jak Kim Gordon!"" (""Be like Kim Gordon!"") ""As a fan, it's just hilarious and awesome to watch what happened on TikTok,"" Raisen says. ""Some are new kids who don't know that she was in Sonic Youth, and they're literally just with the song and packing a suitcase in the videos and just being like, 'This [is] hard. I like this.'"" In the music video, Gordon's daughter, Coco Gordon Moore, is a young woman escaping the comforts of home through a bedroom window and making a run for it. She's seen again in the video for Gordon's ""I'm a Man,"" lounging at home as a young man in a fringed western coat spies on her longingly - maybe less for Coco herself than for her life as a woman. The video mingles grainy 8mm footage with clips from vintage western movies, as Gordon's vocals take on the persona of confused masculinity: ""I'm not ideal/I'm a person/I won the war, but lost my way/But I can buy as much as anyone/I like to shave my beard just so/manicure my nails/put on a skirt/But at the end of the day/I lost my way/Don't make me have to hide, or explain, what I am inside."" The lyrics were partly inspired by the example of conservative politicians, including Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has been ""complaining like he's a victim of femininity or feminism,"" Gordon says. ""It's very whiny and dangerous.""  During the 2014 induction of Nirvana into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Gordon was one of four women to join surviving members of the band and fill in for the late Kurt Cobain. She was there with Joan Jett, Annie Clark (a.k.a. St. Vincent) and Lorde. Gordon performed an especially intense, agonized ""Aneurysm"" that she described in her memoir as ""a four-minute-long explosion of grief, where I could finally let myself feel the furious sadness of Kurt's death and everything else surrounding it."" ""Kurt, he had his girl energy,"" Gordon says now of the appropriateness of women stepping in for him. ""That was kind of the best thing I liked about it."" The ceremony itself, she adds, was otherwise ""kind of a bore. It was just filled with old white guys.""  Although Sonic Youth is no longer active as a recording or touring unit, the band still exists to deal with its history, partly in the form of archival releases of live shows and rarities, curated by drummer Steve Shelley. Gordon is as involved as she wants to be in those releases, but she's mostly moved on. Even so, she sees her current work as fully linked to her past, a later chapter in an ongoing evolution. ""I see them as a continuation ... as far as the guitar sounds and the nontraditional structure of the music being the same as music in New York in the late '70s, early '80s, and no wave bands I was influenced by. So in that way I'm still doing the same thing. There's just beats with it and other sounds."" ""No Home Record"" was released just months before COVID-19 landed hard in the U.S. and Europe, causing most of the live music industry to shut down for more than a year. Gordon's touring plans for 2020 were canceled, and she and her band abruptly returned home. She spent some of her unexpected downtime working on her canvases with music or podcasts playing in the background. Gordon has shown in galleries most of her adult life, an identity that easily fit in with her role as a major player on the avant-garde side of rock. Although she's been ambivalent at times about mixing those roles, Gordon now sees her output in music and painting all as one thing. ""I really tried to keep them separate for a long time because of just the weird thing of being asked to be in shows and that are like, 'musicians who make art,''"" she says. And yet, her themes and ideas from one discipline will often appear in the other. In a solo exhibition last year at the 303 Gallery in New York, Gordon included a painting called ""The Collective,"" a large canvas splashed with layers of pink, blue and red, with iPhone-shaped holes carved out. At the same gallery in 2018, she showed an abstract nude called ""Airbnb Silverlake,"" presaging her song ""Airbnb"" from her solo debut. At the coffeehouse, a young woman at the next table leans in to thank Gordon for mentioning her late father, cinematographer Harris Savides, in Gordon's 2015 memoir ""Girl in a Band."" Savides was on the crew of ""Last Days,"" director Gus Van Sant's fictionalized account of Cobain's final days before his suicide. Gordon had a small but moving cameo as a caring record company exec visiting the despairing rocker named Blake and urging him to leave with her. ""Oh, my God. He was the sweetest,"" Gordon says of the respected cinematographer. ""Lovely to meet you. He was great, your dad."" Over the decades, she has collaborated with an impressive collection of artists and musicians, including Yoko Ono, Kim Deal, Mike Kelley and Richard Kern, intermingling genres and disciplines.  ""It feels good as a way to bridge the two worlds,"" Gordon says of these connections and the forward motion they represent. ""I really do feel like this record is like, 'Well, this is the work I'm doing now.'"" This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"February 15, 2024",Kim Kardashian Reportedly Has One Major Rule When it Comes to Kanye West's New Wife Hanging Out with Their Kids,145,"  When it comes to her kids, Kim Kardashian does not play around. That's why we aren't surprised at all about her alleged rule for ex Kanye ""Ye"" West and his new wife Bianca Censori. Apparently, Kardashian wants Censori to ""cover up"" around her kids North, 10, Saint, 8, Chicago, 6, and Psalm, 4, who she shares with Ye. Kim Kardashian shares her parenting tip for fostering self-esteem in kids: Be proud of yourself! https://t.co/7CxcfK7rhR - SheKnows (@SheKnows) December 8, 2023 ""Kim instructed Kanye to never let Bianca dress like that around their kids,"" a source told Daily Mail today about the Australian architect's revealing fashion choices. ""She is truly surprised that Kanye would let his wife leave the house like that."" If you're wondering what ""like that"" means, it's basically dressing as naked as legally possible out in public. This includes wearing a skimpy piece of clothing that looked like a ""taco shell"" at the Super Bowl and wearing nothing under a clear raincoat. (Daily Mail has pictures HERE.) Kim 2.0 LOS ANGELES, CA - MAY 13: Kanye West and Bianca Censori are seen on May 13, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Rachpoot/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images) A source previously told Daily Mail that the rapper is making Censori dress this way, and people close to her are worried. ""Everyone is extremely concerned. This isn't who she is,"" they said. ""She is an incredibly outspoken and lively person who is never one to keep her mouth shut."" The insider continued, ""Kanye is trying to make Bianca into a radicalized version of Kim - almost like Kim 2.0. The difference is that when Kim was with Kanye he was respected in the fashion world. He has since lost this respect."" Yikes! Whether or not it's true that the ""Runaway"" singer is forcing Censori to dress inappropriately (while he is often completely covered up, including a face mask) or it's her choice, apparently the SKIMS founder doesn't care. She doesn't have animosity toward Censori; she just doesn't want her kids to be around when their stepmom is wearing next to nothing. The insider told Daily Mail in the interview today: ""Kanye did the same thing he is doing with Bianca to Kim throughout their marriage. The difference is that when Kanye dressed Kim, he was respected as a person - as an artist."" They added, ""Unfortunately, Kim knows what Bianca is going through - but she feels Bianca should have known what she was getting into.""

(Photo by Monica Schipper/Getty Images) When Censori and West got married at the end of 2022, The Kardashians star reportedly requested to meet her to set some guidelines. ""She's sent a message through her team to Kanye's team, basically saying congratulations, and given that it looks like Bianca may soon becoming a stepmom to the kids, she would like to have a sit down to get to know her in a private meeting,"" an insider told The U.S. Sun in Jan. 2023. This meeting was supposedly to ""establish ground rules,"" which include ""guides on care, food, electronics, and naps."" ""They are Kanye's rules anyway so he can't object,"" the source added. Kanye West's Defense LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - JUNE 26: Kanye West onstage during the 2022 BET Awards at Microsoft Theater on June 26, 2022 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images) West has posted pictures of his wife in skimpy outfits on Instagram, which recently drew backlash. He addressed hateful comments in another post this week, captioned, ""Ima post my wife as much as I want bro It makes me happy Some people don't want you to be happy They want you to make them happy I decided to make myself happy and I'm happy with that."" This isn't the first time Ye has publicly defended his wife. In a now-deleted post last month, he praised her on her birthday. ""Happy birthday to the most beautiful super bad fun iconic muse inspirational talented artist masters degree in architecture 140 IQ,"" he wrote, ""loving by my side every day when half the world turned their backs on me and the most amazing step mom to our children I love you so much thank you for sharing your life with me.""

At least North has. Earlier this week, she shared three things she was ""grateful"" for on TikTok in a handwritten note, which has since been deleted. North's wrote, according to Buzzfeed, said, ""I am grateful for the VULTURES 1 album because it is insanely good. I am also grateful for the black vulture because if vultures weren't alive this amazing album wouldn't have come out."" She added, ""Lastly, I am grateful for the song CARNIVAL,"" along with a hand-drawn version of the Vultures 1 album cover, which features Censori's naked butt.

"March 16, 2024",Kogi chef Roy Choi debuts a new 'backyard barbecue' taco stand in Palms,146,"  Last week Roy Choi was looking for the telltale signs: a lot of cursing, a lot of eyes rolling back with every bite. He was secretly launching a new taco stand - his first L.A. restaurant debut since 2016 - and as the crowd began to grow at his no-frills street stall in Palms, he saw every indication that Tacos Por Vida is on the right track. ""Other chefs are looking for 'soigné' or 'excellent,' 'delicious,' 'fantastic' ... all those words that they use,"" Choi said. ""I'm looking for 'f-.' If people say 'f-,' it's primal."" The Kogi founder and celebrity chef set up the blue- and red-tented stands next to the Palms location of his Kogi truck, where he and his team have been serving Korean-tinged tacos, quesadillas and burgers since 2010.  At Tacos Por Vida, the street-style tacos and burritos are more straightforward. Handmade tortillas, a blend of corn and flour, blister then swell on the plancha and serve as warm vessels for charcoal-and-wood-grilled steak, pork, chicken and mushroom. Choi said he wanted to use live fire and provide something that wasn't necessarily Korean-influenced - something that felt more like the taco stands he grew up visiting, including his favorite, Tire Shop Taqueria. ""I moved around a lot here in L.A. and I grew up on taco stands, attached markets and backyard tacos,"" Choi said. ""Those memories and everything about it is a very specific taco for me. ... We're bringing the history of a certain part of Los Angeles into this taco. The taco is not regional to any place in Mexico - it's regional to here, and it's regional to our story and our life."" The best way to describe it, he says, is what one might find at a backyard barbecue in La Puente. Kogi financial chief and manager Freddy Gonzalez - who's from La Puente - provided his own small home grill while Choi awaited delivery of his equipment . On March 5, with a little extra space on their rented Kogi lot, they quietly erected a tent, lit the coals and hand-wrote the pared-down menu of $2 tacos and $10 burritos. Choi always liked to finish his tacos with a little salt and pepper and lime in addition to sauces, and at Tacos Por Vida he's using two finishing-salt blends and constructing the tacos for guests, as opposed to allowing for customization over the ubiquitous tubs of salsas, chopped cilantro, onions and pickled vegetables. These recipes are built on the foundations of watching moms, aunties and grandmas cooking, both in Mexican and Korean home kitchens. His asada marinade - a blend of lime, salt, garlic, chiles, cilantro and beer - is the culmination of roughly 20 styles he's witnessed and cooked throughout the decades. In a way, he says, it's almost a throwback to the beer can chicken he served at his now-shuttered Culver City restaurant A-Frame. The just-caramelized pork is what Choi refers to as ""a psychedelic al pastor,"" marinated in a blend of nearly 30 ingredients, including gochujang, harissa, achiote, garlic, cilantro, green onions, orange, pineapple and sesame oil. At first he considered using a trompo but opted for a long charcoal-and-wood-burning grill. ""As a cook, I don't like to put things out there that I don't feel like I've got something to say with or that I've been trained on,"" he said. ""There's people that do that well; I don't feel like I can offer anything to that, but I'm really good on the grill. There's some people that are really good with tweezers, really good with emulsions and sauces. For me, you get me around live fire and I can make s- happen."" Two days of service this week saw lines stretch down the block. On Tuesday, Choi told The Times that customers began lining up an hour and a half before service. Tacos Por Vida will return March 28 and 29, then on April 2 will officially launch, at which point Choi hopes to operate Tuesday to Saturday from 5 to 11 p.m. The month of March is serving as Tacos Por Vida's soft opening, where recipes, hours and items might change. They're experimenting as they go, testing ratios of salsas and wood; it's currently cherry and mesquite, but perhaps with a bit more almond wood or charcoal thrown into the mix in the coming weeks. ""We literally are putting the pieces together in real time,"" Choi said, adding, ""For us it's kind of like that old saying of fixing the plane while it's still flying."" With nearly two decades of operating Kogi, the children of some of Choi's employees are now old enough to work and want to learn the business. According to the chef, as much as two-thirds of the employees have been with Kogi for more than a decade; he's hoping to create an offshoot that can bring new family members into the fold, as well as create new menu items. ""With Kogi, I can't change f- anything on it,"" he said. ""The people who love Kogi will go f- apes-."" With tacos priced at $2 apiece - roughly half the cost of Kogi's - Choi also hopes Tacos Por Vida can provide a less expensive option for customers.  Should Tacos Por Vida's Palms stand prove successful, Choi and his team could expand the operation to other Kogi-truck outposts such as Whittier, Long Beach, Temple City and Carson.  ""In the early, early days of Kogi, people thought that it was this orchestrated scavenger hunt,"" he said of its 2008 beginnings. ""We were just looking for parking and trying to figure things out on the freeway, and posting updates on Twitter, or we got a flat tire or were running late, or we ran out of food. But on the other side of it, it felt like it was this clue or this big, mysterious game. Fifteen years later with Tacos Por Vida, nothing's changed with us. We're still a small, independent, family-run company, and this was just an idea we had a couple months ago."" Of course, things have changed for Choi over the last 16 years. Choi went from hometown culinary hero to international celebrity chef. Since helping to define food-truck culture with Kogi, he's appeared as one of Time magazine's most influential people, authored a cookbook, hosted and appeared on multiple TV shows and web series, served as culinary advisor on Jon Favreau's film ""Chef"" and more recently expanded to Las Vegas with lauded restaurant Best Friend. Some of his surprise at the overwhelming response to Tacos Por Vida can be traced to how much he feels the food world has changed since he and his team last introduced a new restaurant to L.A. When they debuted Locol in 2016 and updated Chego in 2017, TikTok hadn't yet launched in the U.S. Food trends, social media and the landscape have changed drastically. ""There were no food influencers, there was no Smorgasburg, there were no small pop-ups to the extent that you see now, restaurants weren't opening at a pace that they are now,"" Choi said. ""So we didn't know if we even mattered that much anymore in the whole scene."" After experiencing the crush of excitement over Tacos Por Vida, he says he now feels a little like beloved former Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela : ""No matter how long ago we played, people still got love for Kogi."" Tacos Por Vida reopens at 3434 Overland Ave., Los Angeles, on March 28 and 29, with a grand opening planned for April 2. This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"December 11, 2023",KTown Plastic Surgery Business Sues Influencer Over TikTok Video Critique,149,"  LOS ANGELES (CNS) - A Koreatown plastic surgery and laser treatment center is suing an influencer for libel and slander regarding her November TikTok video critique of the business, in which she said that employees paid little attention to her when she walked into the lobby and urged viewers to take their patronage elsewhere. ""Horrible, horrible place. There's so many places in Koreatown, and Wave is definitely on the list to do not go, and they actually treated me the worst than any place I've walked into,"" defendant Tina Kim said, according to the Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit brought by WAVE Plastic Surgery and Aesthetic Laser Center. ""Do not go to Wave Plastic in Koreatown Los Angeles,"" Kim further says, according to the complaint, which seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. A representative for Kim could not be immediately reached. Her TikTok video is still online. According to the suit brought Thursday, WAVE ""provides a luxurious environment for patients desiring outstanding outpatient surgery"" and the staff and providers ""strive to provide cutting-edge and state-of-the-art technology and services for patients in the field of aesthetic and anti-aging plastic surgery."" WAVE has industry-leading doctors who specialize in many surgical and non-surgical procedures and has offices in Los Angeles, Costa Mesa, Arcadia, Rowland Heights and San Francisco, according to the suit, which further states that Kim has more than 86,000 TikTok followers and 4.5 million combined likes on all her TikTok posts. The video at issue was posted Nov. 7 by Kim through her public account, @kdramalogic, and is tiled ""My review of walking into Wave Plastic Surgery Center in Koreatown L.A."" the suit states. ""I walked in, I walked towards the reception, none of them greeted me,"" Kim says. ""Nothing. Nothing. I walked back up towards the reception area and there (are) three girls there. One is like on the phone. The other one is kinda just talking, and I'm just standing there, and you would think one of the three girls would go, 'Oh, hey, so can I help you, do you have an questions?' Nothing, nothing."" When Kim left the business, she made a disparaging remark to the front desk employees, made a thumbs-down gesture and identified herself as an influencer, the suit states.

"March 11, 2024","Lady Gaga Calls Out Transphobic Comments After Photoshoot With Dylan Mulvaney: ""This Kind of Hatred Is Violence""",150,"  After Lady Gaga received transphobic comments following her photo shoot with trans TikToker Dylan Mulvaney, the pop star shared a statement on Instagram decrying the negative remarks. ""It's appalling to me that a post about National [sic] Women's Day by Dylan Mulvaney and me would be met with such vitriol and hatred,"" wrote Gaga. ""When I see a newspaper reporting on hatred but calling it 'backlash' I feel it is important to clarify that hatred is hatred, and this kind of hatred is violence. 'Backlash' would imply that people who love or respect Dylan and me didn't like something we did. This is not backlash. This is hatred."" She continued, ""But it is not surprising given the immense work that it's obvious we still have to do as a society to make room for transgender lives to be cherished and upheld by all of us."" The ""Born This Way"" singer shared that she feels ""very protective,"" not just toward Mulvaney but also toward the trans community as a whole, ""who continues to lead the way with their endless grace and inspiration in the face of constant degradation, intolerance and physical, verbal and mental violence."" Gaga added that while she's not intending to speak for the trans community as a cis woman, she hopes ""all women will come together to honor us ALL for International Women's Day, and may we do that always until THE DAY that all women are celebrated equally. That all people are celebrated equally."" Mulvaney acknowledged Gaga's support in the comments, writing, ""You mean the world to me. Love ya."" Over the weekend, Mulvaney celebrated International Women's Day with a photo shoot alongside Gaga. The two posed in matching black outfits and embraced for the camera. It appears that the shoot was part of a campaign for Gaga's cosmetics line, Haus Labs, as the TikToker tagged the brand in her behind-the-scenes TikTok. In the morning of the shoot, the influencer noted in a TikTok that Gaga is ""the only woman that's transferred over"" from her 2023 vision board. In a behind-the-scenes video shared on her Instagram, Mulvaney is heard telling Gaga about the vision board, to which the singer responded, ""I'm putting this on my vision board for life.""

"April 2, 2024",Laguna Beach High School Investigating AI-Generated Photos of Students,151,"  LAGUNA BEACH (CNS) - Laguna Beach High School today is investigating reports of inappropriate or nude photos of students created with artificial intelligence being distributed, and the Laguna Beach Police Department is assisting the school district. Principal Jason Alleman sent a letter to parents Monday about the investigation into the photos. In the letter, Alleman said ""these incidents can have far-reaching impact on our campus culture."" ""These actions not only compromise individual dignity but also undermine the positive and supportive environment we aim to foster at LBHS,"" Alleman said in the letter. The photos might have been shared among students through text messages, and parents were informed about the photos last week. The school has not identified the students responsible for either creating or sharing the photos, nor revealed the number of alleged victims. However, the father of a 17-year-old boy believed by some students and parents of creating the images after seeing a tutorial on AI on TikTok said his son suffered a traumatic brain injury while snowboarding when he was 11 in 2019. As a result of the brain injury, the father said, the teen struggles with the part of the brain that governs decision-making. ""He's really, really sorry"" about what's happened, his father said. When his son got hurt snowboarding, ""he was given a 1 percent chance to live,"" his father said. He survived ""by all accounts by literally an act of God,"" his father added. The injury affected multiple parts of the brain, including his frontal lobe, so he has problems with impulse control, his father said. He has issues with his memory and walks with his arm locked in the air, his father added. The images in question appear to be very crude and not realistic, his father said. The attorney for the family, Jacqueline Goodman, appealed to reporters to back down from publicizing the incident and to let school officials go through the process of investigating the allegations. ""You have all of these news vans parked outside of the school and it's appalling,"" Goodman said. ""Let the system take care of it as it ought to. We're all in a sort of fact-gathering situation and it's just not appropriate to be outing him, staying at his school and essentially convicting him before authorities have any way to consider this. ... It would be unfortunate to treat an adult like this, but particularly appalling to treat a disabled child like this."" The Laguna Beach Unified School District released a statement about the photos and said the safety and security of students is the district's top priority. ""We are required by law to keep student discipline matters confidential to protect the privacy and well-being of our students. In any situation that arises, the safety and security of our students is always our top priority. Simultaneously, it falls within our role as educators to guide students toward understanding the consequences of their actions, particularly in terms of their impact on peers and the wider campus community. ""High school is a pivotal time for shaping students, offering us the opportunity to nurture them into empathetic individuals who are mindful of the world around them. Maintaining a careful balance between accountability and empathy is essential as we navigate and address critical issues."" Laguna Beach High School is planning to host panel discussions this week covering online privacy, legal and ethical considerations of sharing content, the impact of online behavior on future opportunities and relationships and managing digital footprints. ""We share deep empathy for the students and families involved, understanding the distress and worry they, as well as the wider student body, may be experiencing,"" Alleman said in his letter to parents. In March, the Beverly Hills Unified School District expelled five eighth-grade students for their involvement in generating and sharing AI-generated nude photos of classmates.

"March 5, 2024",Landon Barker Revealed His Tourette Diagnosis in the Most Low-Key Powerful Way,152,"  Landon Barker is setting the record straight on his health diagnoses. In a recent TikTok, the son of Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker and Shanna Moakler responded plainly to a commenter asking if he had Tourette syndrome. ""I actually do have very, very minor Tourette's,"" Barker confirmed, saying it was something he always thought he would speak about ""eventually."" The ""Friends With Your Ex"" singer went on to say that he's experienced Tourette syndrome ""since I can remember, like preschool."" The memories are vivid, he said, because a teacher ""used to accuse me of rolling my eyes at her - because one of my tics was a weird thing I do with my eyes."" Now 20, Barker says his Tourette's manifests as head jerks or jaw movements. ""It really just acts up in nervous situations and nerve-wracking environments for me,"" he explained. That's not an uncommon experience. According to Mayo Clinic, tics - which are the ""hallmark sign"" of Tourette syndrome - can get worse when you're stressed, anxious, tired, excited, or sick. And while Barker shared a few motor tics (aka tics that involve movement) that he experiences, tics can also involved sound (vocal tics). They can be simple tics, which are brief and repetitive, like eye blinking or head jerking; or more distinct and coordinated movements across several muscle groups, like stepping in a certain pattern or hopping, which are called complex tics. Tourette syndrome is three to four ties more likely in males than females, and many people with the condition don't require treatment, as long as the tics don't interfere with their life. In fact, many people find they have fewer tics as they get older, according to the CDC, and that tics may become less severe or go away when they're concentrating hard on a task. There is still something of a stigma around Tourette syndrome, though. Kids in school may experience bullying and self-esteem issues, Mayo Clinic notes, which is why public figures like Barker speaking out about the condition - and doing so in this relaxed, matter-of-fact way - is so important. He's not the only one, either; artists like Billie Eilish and Lewis Capaldi have also spoken about their experience with Tourette syndrome over the last few years.  ""I wanted to talk about it, because why not?"" Barker said at the close of his TikTok. Sure, it's just one quick video, but that kind of low-key attitude represents a small, important shift that can help destigmatize conditions like Tourette syndrome.

"March 27, 2024","Latest chapter in her evolution; Sonic Youth's Kim Gordon ponders her return to L.A., new album and TikTok hit.",154,"  For Kim Gordon, returning to Los Angeles was once her least likely destiny. She largely grew up here, and as an aspiring young artist, she'd been desperate to escape SoCal suburbia and the commercial imperative she felt in Los Angeles. So she left for Manhattan, inspired by the examples of Merce Cunningham and Robert Rauschenberg, of the scene at Andy Warhol's Factory and the Judson dance collective. In New York, she thrived as a painter, an underground style icon and, most famously, as a member of the influential noise-rock band Sonic Youth. ""I also felt like L.A. was just a town about money,"" recalls Gordon, who now lives in Los Feliz. ""At some point, it switched. It was maybe 2008, and somehow L.A. started looking more quaint. And New York became what it has really always been, which is about money."" Ever since Sonic Youth ended in 2011, along with her marriage to band co-founder Thurston Moore, Gordon has embraced a diverse flurry of projects. She's put renewed focus on her gallery work and embarked on a series of collaborations, including the experimental guitar duo Body/Head with Bill Nace. She has performed live improvisations at L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art, the Louvre in Paris and elsewhere with choreographer Dimitri Chamblas, who interacts with Gordon as she unleashes driving patterns of distortion on guitar. At age 70, she is two albums into a vibrant solo music career. On March 8, she released ""The Collective,"" an uncompromising blend of noise and melody, bursts of avant-garde guitar and underground hip-hop. It's a sound that makes sense in the context of her long career but without sounding like an echo from her past. The album's 11 songs are defiantly of the moment and a direct result of her return to L.A. On a recent rainy day, Gordon steps into a coffeehouse on Hillhurst Avenue, looking much as she has since the early '90s, in a shiny black raincoat, her straight blond hair cropped into a crisp bob. It's her third interview of the day as she prepares for an upcoming solo tour set to land at L.A.'s Regent Theater on Wednesday. ""It's exciting. It's a little nerve-racking. I have to memorize all those lyrics,"" she says with a laugh. In Los Angeles, she's found a key collaborator in producer and co-writer Justin Raisen, who recorded her solo albums at his home studio in Glassell Park, starting with ""No Home Record"" in 2019. A modernist with a taste for the raw and unpredictable, Raisen has recently worked with artists who stretch from Lil Yachty and Kid Cudi to John Cale and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. ""I actually never really intended to make a solo record,"" Gordon says with a smile. ""I accidentally met Justin Raisen, and he kept bugging me to make a record. After we initially made something together, I was like, 'OK, I like his sensibility.' "" Her first track with Raisen was ""Murdered Out,"" a 2019 electronic beat of anxious foreboding with Gordon's voice on edge warning: ""Murdered out of my heart / Covered in black matte spray / Will you see when I'm not there?"" ""The thing about collaborations is somehow, when they're working, they give you a certain confidence to really reach for ideas and take risks that maybe you wouldn't on your own,"" Gordon says. Her interest in hip-hop stretches back at least to her first time hearing LL Cool J's debut album, ""Radio,"" in 1985, and its influence was sometimes felt in her work with Sonic Youth. She was joined by Public Enemy's Chuck D on the band's song ""Kool Thing,"" and in 1993, Sonic Youth, recorded the woozy ""I Love You Mary Jane"" with Cypress Hill for the hugely influential rap-rock movie soundtrack from ""Judgment Night."" She also mingled beats and noise in a 2000 collaboration with Ikue Mori and DJ Olive that Sonic Youth released on its SYR indie label. The new songs are part of that same lineage. ""The reason it sounds relevant and still her is because she's more open to danger and taking chances than new popular artists,"" Raisen says later. ""She's willing to take those chances, and she's willing to question."" The title of ""The Collective"" is an idea inspired by ""The Candy House,"" a novel by Jennifer Egan that describes the human impact of an app that allows users to plug into the experiences and memories of anyone who uploads into the collective and a mysterious company called Mandala. ""The catch is you have to upload your own memories and experiences to be part of the access that's making yourself vulnerable,"" Gordon says. ""I thought it was sort of close to where we are now already in technology. The record, to me, feels a little sci-fi in a sense."" On the cover is a blurry image of a hand holding a phone photographed by musician Twig Harper. It was shot at a Body/Head show last year at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills. ""I guess when you play live with an audience, we do become kind of a collective, whether you like it or not,"" she says. ""It's part of this experience."" The album opens with ""Bye Bye,"" a track of swirling, ominous tension, as tough beats collide with grinding bursts of her guitar. The effect is gorgeously imperfect as her vocal then rattles off an otherwise mundane packing list, her delivery detached yet quietly obsessed: ""Hoodie, toothpaste, brush, foundation / Contact solution, mascara, lip mask, eye mask / Ear plugs, travel shampoo, con-di- tion-er ..."" ""It was such a compelling beat, and I thought it'd be cool to contrast it with something really banal like a to-do packing list,"" she says with a laugh. ""I'm limited as a singer, so there are things that I'm aware of that I can do using space. It's weird. When I have the right tone in my earphones -- with an effect or something -- it gives me a certain confidence. It's like I transform into another person."" That unconventional vocal style was established during her time in Sonic Youth, where it fit easily amid the band's dissonant noise rock, even as it occasionally reached MTV and the '90s commercial airwaves in the form of ""Kool Thing"" and ""Bull in the Heather."" Gordon's spoken vocals are as much avant-garde as they are directly inspired by the speaking-vocal style of the '60s girl group the Shangri-Las. But it's been a new discovery for at least some younger listeners astonished by what they are hearing in ""Bye Bye,"" the new album's first single. With the song's January release, Gordon unexpectedly became a TikTok sensation, as both longtime fans and young women discovering her for the first time posted videos of themselves lip-syncing to the song's shopping list lyrics or just listening. One young woman in headphones posted how she'll ""Never have to make another packing list again,"" as she's seen on-camera shoving items from the lyrics into a backpack. A red-haired woman with a cartoon mouse tattoo on her bicep posted: ""I think Kim Gordon just cured my fear of aging."" Another young listener in Poland just nods her head to the beat, and writes: ""Byc jak Kim Gordon!"" (""Be like Kim Gordon!"") ""As a fan, it's just hilarious and awesome to watch what happened on TikTok,"" Raisen says. ""Some are new kids who don't know that she was in Sonic Youth, and they're literally just with the song and packing a suitcase in the videos and just being like, 'This [is] hard. I like this.' "" In the music video, Gordon's daughter, Coco Gordon Moore, is a young woman escaping the comforts of home through a bedroom window and making a run for it. She's seen again in the video for Gordon's ""I'm a Man,"" lounging at home as a young man in a fringed western coat spies on her longingly -- maybe less for Coco herself than for her life as a woman. The video mingles grainy 8mm footage with clips from vintage western movies, as Gordon's vocals take on the persona of confused masculinity: ""I'm not ideal / I'm a person / I won the war, but lost my way / But I can buy as much as anyone / I like to shave my beard just so / manicure my nails / put on a skirt / But at the end of the day / I lost my way / Don't make me have to hide, or explain, what I am inside."" The lyrics were partly inspired by the example of conservative politicians, including Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who has been ""complaining like he's a victim of femininity or feminism,"" Gordon says. ""It's very whiny and dangerous."" During the 2014 induction of Nirvana into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Gordon was one of four women to join surviving members of the band and fill in for the late Kurt Cobain. She was there with Joan Jett, Annie Clark (a.k.a. St. Vincent) and Lorde. Gordon performed an especially intense, agonized ""Aneurysm"" that she described in her memoir as ""a four-minute-long explosion of grief, where I could finally let myself feel the furious sadness of Kurt's death and everything else surrounding it."" ""Kurt, he had his girl energy,"" Gordon says now of the appropriateness of women stepping in for him. ""That was kind of the best thing I liked about it."" The ceremony itself, she adds, was otherwise ""kind of a bore. It was just filled with old white guys."" Although Sonic Youth is no longer active as a recording or touring unit, the band still exists to deal with its history, partly in the form of archival releases of live shows and rarities, curated by drummer Steve Shelley. Gordon is as involved as she wants to be in those releases, but she's mostly moved on. Even so, she sees her current work as fully linked to her past, a later chapter in an ongoing evolution. ""I see them as a continuation ... as far as the guitar sounds and the nontraditional structure of the music being the same as music in New York in the late '70s, early '80s, and no wave bands I was influenced by. So in that way I'm still doing the same thing. There's just beats with it and other sounds."" ""No Home Record"" was released just months before COVID-19 landed hard in the U.S. and Europe, causing most of the live music industry to shut down for more than a year. Gordon's touring plans for 2020 were canceled, and she and her band abruptly returned home. She spent some of her unexpected downtime working on her canvases with music or podcasts playing in the background. Gordon has shown in galleries most of her adult life, an identity that easily fit in with her role as a major player on the avant-garde side of rock. Although she's been ambivalent at times about mixing those roles, Gordon now sees her output in music and painting all as one thing. ""I really tried to keep them separate for a long time because of just the weird thing of being asked to be in shows and that are like, 'musicians who make art,' "" she says. And yet, her themes and ideas from one discipline will often appear in the other. In a solo exhibition last year at the 303 Gallery in New York, Gordon included a painting called ""The Collective,"" a large canvas splashed with layers of pink, blue and red, with iPhone-shaped holes carved out. At the same gallery in 2018, she showed an abstract nude called ""Airbnb Silverlake,"" presaging her song ""Airbnb"" from her solo debut. At the coffeehouse, a young woman at the next table leans in to thank Gordon for mentioning her late father, cinematographer Harris Savides, in Gordon's 2015 memoir ""Girl in a Band."" Savides was on the crew of ""Last Days,"" director Gus Van Sant's fictionalized account of Cobain's final days before his suicide. Gordon had a small but moving cameo as a caring record company exec visiting the despairing rocker named Blake and urging him to leave with her. ""Oh, my God. He was the sweetest,"" Gordon says of the respected cinematographer. ""Lovely to meet you. He was great, your dad."" Over the decades, she has collaborated with an impressive collection of artists and musicians, including Yoko Ono, Kim Deal, Mike Kelley and Richard Kern, intermingling genres and disciplines. ""It feels good as a way to bridge the two worlds,"" Gordon says of these connections and the forward motion they represent. ""I really do feel like this record is like, 'Well, this is the work I'm doing now.' "" Graphic    PHOTO: ""IT'S EXCITING. It's a little nerve-racking,"" Kim Gordon says of her solo tour.

"January 31, 2024",Lili Reinhart Reveals She Was Diagnosed With Alopecia,155,"  Lili Reinhart has shared that she was recently diagnosed with alopecia.  The Riverdale star took to TikTok on Monday to post a video of her undergoing red light therapy, and wrote in the clip, ""Was just diagnosed with alopecia in the midst of a major depressive episode."" Reinhart didn't share many details about the diagnosis. Alopecia occurs when the ""immune system attacks hair follicles and causes hair loss,"" according to the National Institute of Health. It typically affects the head and face but can cause hair loss from any part of the body.  The cause of the condition is unknown and it impacts as many as 6.7 million people in the United States alone, the National Alopecia Areata Foundation reports. In the footage shared to social media, Reinhart can be seen lip-syncing to audio of a man saying, ""I'm pushed beyond the limits of what a person should be pushed to endure."" The Look Both Ways actress also captioned the post, ""Red light therapy is my new best friend #alopecia #mentalhealth."" While the National Institute of Health says there is no cure for alopecia, red light therapy is reportedly a treatment that helps stimulate hair growth. @lilireinhart Red light therapy is my new best friend. #alopecia #mentalhealth original sound - Sam Huberty Reinhart has previously been publicly open about personal battles, including mental health, depression and anxiety. In 2020, she said in an interview with Refinery29 that her career and mental health had its ups and downs, and recalled at one point that she felt like she was in a ""black tunnel [that] was never going to end."" But the Hustlers actress admitted she tried to face her pain and struggles ""head-on,"" rather than filling a ""void"" with outside factors. ""I've seen a lot of people when it comes to heartache and grief and breakups, and they try to get that void filled with sex, with coke, with food, with drinking, [but] the void is still there,"" Reinhart told the outlet at the time.

Lopez planned a three-part project for the release of her first album in over a decade, This Is Me ... Now. She made This Is Me ... Now: A Love Story as a visual vehicle for her record, giving fans a wider glimpse at her many complicated romances and reunion with now-husband Ben Affleck. The documentary, The Greatest Love Story Never Told, was filmed to show the process of self-financing the musical movie, as well as giving a look at the multihyphenate's dynamic with Affleck behind closed doors.  While speaking with THR about This Is Me ... Now: A Love Story, Lopez explained why she decided to make a musical movie experience, rather than creating individual music videos for the album. ""I didn't think it was right to throw out a video and do the normal thing. I wanted to do something really different with this. I called [music video director] Dave Meyers, we sat down together and I played him some of the music. He says that I sang some of the music to him, too,"" she said.  Lopez continued, ""I told him that I made this album 20 years ago, and now we're here, and he said, 'That's the story. The story you just told me is the story.' I told him that I didn't want to tell the story of Ben and I, because people know that story. I wanted to do something different. So we embarked upon how to do that in a visual way with singing, dancing and funny in a life-like way.""

"January 12, 2024","Lynn Yamada Davis, TikTok chef known for playful 'Cooking With Lynja' videos, dies",157,"  Lynn Yamada Davis, a social media star known for her fast-paced and kooky ""Cooking With Lynja"" online tutorials, has died.  Hannah Shofet, Davis' eldest daughter, confirmed Friday to The Times that her mother died Jan. 1 at Riverview Medical Center in New Jersey from esophageal cancer. She was 67.  In a phone interview, Shofet celebrated Davis for being a ""real poster child of having a family and also pursuing your dreams."" She also praised her mother for representing older women and Japanese culture on social media.  ""When she would go to award shows or was invited to these amazing things, it's kinda cool that she was this older ... Asian American woman that was doing these things in the spotlight,"" Shofet said.  In a tribute published Friday on Davis' YouTube channel , her son Tim Davis recalled her ""peaceful"" final moments and shared several photos of the social media sensation throughout her life.  Holding a recent photo of his mother, Tim said she looked ""so intelligent and elegant in this picture."" ""When I think of my mom, this is who I think of,"" he said. ""The Internet's grandma. She was the best. So glad you guys got to experience how wonderful of a person she was and that you guys treated her so well."" Davis was a maverick when it came to bite-sized cooking tutorials on social media platforms including TikTok, Instagram and YouTube. In 2020, she started her ""Cooking With Lynja"" YouTube channel, in collaboration with Tim, who was a freelance videographer at the time. Amid the heat of the COVID-19 pandemic, she served up mouth-watering recipes and Gen Z humor in the form of wacky, over-the-top edits and cheeky jokes. She amassed a following of more than 9.6 million subscribers on YouTube, 2.2 million Instagram followers and 17.6 million TikTok followers.  In addition to Shofet, Davis is survived by husband Keith Davis, daughter Becky Steinberg, sons Tim Davis and Sean Davis and siblings Jay Yamada and Karen Yamada Dolce.  The family has already held a funeral for the TikTok star. They noted that fans can donate to the Monmouth County SPCA or the Monmouth & Ocean chapter of food charity FulFill in Davis' honor.

"March 6, 2024",Magic? Miracle cure? The truth behind L.A.'s magnesium craze,158,"  Over dinner in Hollywood, a friend confides that she's spritzing it on the soles of her feet at night and getting ""the best sleep of my life."" At Erewhon in Silver Lake, a noticeably focused and relaxed employee tells me she stirs it into tea for focus and relaxation. In my TikTok feed, a woman tries to end her three-day battle with constipation by chugging it straight from the bottle. (Disclaimer: Don't.) Her giddy victory speech, full of graphic details that absolutely cannot be repeated here, has 27.8 million views and counting. All three of these people name the same ingredient as the key to their sweet relief - not some newly patented molecule or ancient herbal extract but one of the most common elements on earth: magnesium. After decades of middle-of-the-alphabet anonymity on vitamin store shelves, the humble metal suddenly is taking a star turn in the wellness community, popping up in thousands of posts and even inspiring its own viral recipe, the Sleepy Girl Mocktail. (Tart cherry juice and magnesium powder, with an optional ring light.) Since the online debut of that elixir on TikTok last year, Google searches for ""magnesium sleep"" have more than doubled, while combined mentions on several other platforms - YouTube, X, Reddit, and Tumblr - have jumped 87%, according to the social media analytics company Sprout Social. Magnesium's online success also has been spurred in part by a Cambrian explosion of products and formulations, each adapted for a different niche in the wellness ecosystem. At Alo Yoga in the Grove, you can pick up Magnesium Reset Spray for misting over tense muscles. (""It's our most popular wellness product,"" an employee there told me.) At Malibu Vitamin Barn, you can grab packs of ""Lypo-Spheric"" magnesium gel, perfect for squeezing into your morning latte. Erewhon sells more than 30 forms of magnesium, each claiming a different benefit: magnesium carbonate for healthy sleep, magnesium bisglycinate for stress relief, ozonated magnesium oxides for better digestion, magnesium L-Threonate for cognitive support - the list goes on. A mere $250 will get you a massage supercharged with ""heat activated"" magnesium oil at the Conrad Hotel downtown. Financially speaking, the wellness industry has finally succeeded where centuries of alchemists failed: turning magnesium into gold. Total sales of the supplement in its myriad forms are projected to top $1.5 billion in 2024, according to the Nutrition Business Journal, and there are no signs of slowing down. ""In the last year, we've brought in a lot of new magnesium products, and it keeps gaining traction,"" said Maren Giuliano, VP of health and wellness at Erewhon, where sales of the supplement are up by more than 50% over last year. ""It's definitely hot right now."" In the wellness world, this isn't even magnesium's first moment in the sun. (Actually, all magnesium started out inside a sun, or rather, inside decaying supernovas where helium and carbon nuclei were fused by unimaginably powerful forces to form new atoms, some of which have had the honor of ending up in Goop's magnesium-rich Detoxifying Superpowder.)  The first recorded magnesium craze started in 1618, when a farmer in the English town of Epsom noticed that his cows wouldn't drink from a bitter pool of water. Perhaps seeking some 17th-century form of clout, he decided to drink it himself. He quickly noticed the laxative effect for which Epsom salts would become world-famous, drawing hordes of stopped-up tourists to the town for decades to come. Over the years, the supplement has been ascribed many medical powers, some more credible than others. In 1934, the New York Times announced a breakthrough discovery by a Johns Hopkins professor who found that ""magnesium tends to sweeten the human disposition and that 'grouchiness' may be caused in part by the absence of this mineral salt in the system."" In our current magnesium moment, the supplement is being marketed as a miracle cure for just about everything from muscle cramps to insomnia. The promise that magnesium can soothe, ground and calm us - like a gravity blanket for the mind - is especially alluring in anxious times when prices are surging, wars fill the news and the embers of the pandemic are still smoldering.  As a result, healthcare professionals are fielding a steady stream of questions from patients who are curious about what magnesium can do for them. The answer, according to experts interviewed for this article, could be summed up as: more than you might think, but less than you might hope. So, what is it good for? Biologically, your body can't run without magnesium. Unless you have a serious chronic illness, you probably have about 25 grams of it in you right now, mostly in your bones. ""Magnesium plays many essential roles in the body,"" said Dr. Zhaoping Li, director of UCLA's Center for Human Nutrition. ""It's part of the muscle relaxation process, it's involved in neurotransmitters. It is an essential part of all cell types. So as you can imagine, lacking it would have wide-spectrum negative impacts on health.""  That doesn't mean you necessarily need to take magnesium supplements, though. While the USDA says that less than half of Americans get their daily recommended dose of magnesium from food, Dr. Li said that medically speaking, deficiency isn't common in otherwise healthy people. ""If anyone has a regular diet, this is not something you would easily lack. The source of magnesium [in food] is pretty wide."" As for magnesium's reputation as a slayer of stress and bringer of sleep, the jury is still out, according to Steven Chen, associate dean for clinical affairs at USC's Alfred E. Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences.  ""The science is not extremely strong in this area,"" he said. ""But there are associations between magnesium supplementation and improvement in depression, improvement in anxiety, in migraine headaches. There are some research reports that suggest that's the case."" Still, magnesium success stories are increasingly easy to find.  ""It's like night and day for some people,"" said Amanda Cohen, a doctor of Chinese medicine and owner of Sourcepoint Wellness in Atwater Village. ""They're like, 'I finally slept through the night.'"" Cohen has used magnesium in her practice for more than a decade because it has a large range of applications for patients and is generally well tolerated. ""It's already in our bodies, so we're just supporting it, whether it's through food or a small dose."" Despite their different backgrounds, the practitioners I spoke to all agree on a few points. First, supplemental magnesium isn't a cure-all, no matter how many social media posts may say otherwise. Second, you should consult a healthcare professional before starting any supplements to rule out harmful effects or interactions. (This is especially important for people with any kind of kidney impairment, since excess magnesium is flushed out in urine.) And finally, in sufficient doses, magnesium will almost certainly make at least one thing happen for you. ""Magnesium citrate is used before colonoscopies to really get the bowel going,"" said Dr. Li. Or, in Cohen's words, ""It can be verymoving."" Turns out the lady in the TikTok video wasn't wrong. Regardless, magnesium seems poised to stick around in wellness circles - even in L.A., where new health trends arrive with the steady rhythm of ocean waves. When I dropped by Moon Juice in Venice on a clear January day, an employee gave me free samples of the company's new Magnesi-Om powders, which sprawl across nearly half a wall of display space.  ""These are very calming, great for anxiety,"" she advised. ""And they come in different flavors, in case you don't like one.""  A few minutes later, I walked up the street to an herbal apothecary that offers rose quartz crystals alongside dropper-bottle tinctures labeled ""Happiness."" When I asked if they sell anything with magnesium, an employee turned apologetic.  ""No,"" she sighed. ""But I wish we did. It's amazing."" Adam Markovitzis a writer and editor based in Los Angeles.

"February 6, 2024",Martin Scorsese and Daughter Francesca Take TikTok to the Super Bowl in New Ad Spot,159,"  Martin Scorsese and his daughter, Francesca, bring their beloved TikTok dynamic to the bigger screen in SquareSpace's new Super Bowl campaign.  In the teaser, released Monday, the famed director attempts to build a website with his daughter's help. Though he acknowledges he's not an expert of science fiction, Marty tells Francesca he wants his new site to tell the story of ""an intergalactic plea for connection.""  Francesca then teaches her dad how to build a domain name for his new digital frontier, and the duo cycles through font options for their homepage.  ""I didn't really know a website could do that,"" Martin says. His daughter replies: ""It's basically not real if it's not on the internet.""  Their back-and-forth mimics the style of the fan-favorite Scorseses TikToks, in which Francesca educates her father on youth culture and slang. The teaser ends with Martin telling Francesca that their new website ""slaps."" ""I really regret ever teaching you that,"" she says.  The remorse is all in jest, though - to Vanity Fair, Francesca said she doesn't ""have any regrets"" teaching her father new words.  ""Sometimes, he will use Gen-Z slang because he's heard it, and it's the funniest thing to me,"" she said. ""I feel like hearing your dad say, 'Oh yeah, that slaps,' or, 'I'm so woke,' or whatever, it's just so cringy to me. It just makes me crack up. He is from a different generation, so it's a little - I wouldn't say embarrassing to hear him say it, but it's funny because it feels like he is really trying to stay current with my generation and with me.""

"April 4, 2024",Matt Czuchry Chimes Into the Longtime 'Gilmore Girls' Debate Over Rory's Boyfriends,160,"  Logan Huntzberger himself, Matt Czuchry, chimed in on the decades-long debate over which of Rory's (Alexis Bledel) boyfriends was the best. And he did it in the most diplomatic way possible.  Czuchry stopped by The Talk to promote his upcoming role in American Horror Story: Delicate and spent some time discussing arguably one of his biggest onscreen characters: Logan in Gilmore Girls.  The debate over which of Rory's boyfriends is the best in the Amy Sherman-Palladino series has been ongoing since the show was first released in the early 2000s and continues to maintain its popularity today.  The daytime show's hosts asked Czuchry about his thoughts on a viral TikTok from last year that raised a point that perhaps both Logan and Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) are below-average partners, and that's why women's standards for men have been so low over the past two decades.  The Resident star laughed as the hosts shared the video and noted, ""We shouldn't be searching for perfection in anything, whether it be relationships or whatever it may be. That show has spanned generations because of the timeless nature of it, and Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino, who created that show, are amazing artists.""  But when it came to expressing his thoughts on specifically who he thinks is the best partner for Rory, Czuchry responded in the most polite way he could.  ""I think that Logan had his strengths and weaknesses, and Jess had his strengths and weaknesses, and Dean [Jared Padalecki] had his strengths and weaknesses, like we all do,"" he shared. ""And I think that the fun of the show is that you've got these characters who are flawed and had these great pieces and everybody debates who's best for Rory because they feel different about their strengths and weaknesses that might match up.""

"November 28, 2023",Matt Rife responds to controversy over his comedy ahead of sold-out Santa Rosa shows,161,"  Nov. 28—Comedian Matt Rife called sensitivity in comedy a ""rumor"" that he doesn't adhere to in a recent interview about his controversial comedy. Rife, a rising star with more than 18 million TikTok followers, is coming to Santa Rosa's Luther Burbank Center for the Arts Wednesday as part of his ""ProbleMATTic World Tour"" for two stand-up shows that quickly sold out when they went on sale in June. While Rife's North Bay fans are eager to see him in-person this week, his new Netflix stand-up comedy special, ""Natural Selection,"" recently caused controversy after clips of him joking about domestic violence went viral. This device is unable to display framed content. Click here to view this embed. ""Natural Selection,"" which premiered Nov. 15 on Netflix, also touches on topics like social media trolls, spirituality and having kids. Earlier this month, Rife talked to Variety about his jokes and audience reactions to them. ""You can say whatever you want. Now, you have to prepare for repercussions. But at the end of the day, it all comes down to how do you sleep at night,"" Rife told the entertainment news magazine in an interview posted online Nov. 14, when asked if he was nervous to offend people with his material. Rife admitted that he likes dark humor, but said that his only intention in comedy is to make people laugh. ""It's never any deeper, never any more or never any less than that. That's all it is to me."" he told Variety. Rife also said that he likes to interact with audiences at his live shows because, ""Even I get tired of my own jokes if you tell them over and over and over again."" The backlash from critics for Rife's domestic violence jokes came in part because he reportedly has a large female following on TikTok, though he calls that a ""misconception."" ""In the beginning yes, because I did blow up on TikTok which is very female dominant ... So, I get that perspective. But when you come to the shows, I mean, it's 50/50,"" he said. In the end, Rife told Variety that he prides himself on making comedy for everybody. ""If you give it an opportunity, I think you'd like it."" ___ (c)2023 The Press Democrat (Santa Rosa, Calif.)

"March 22, 2024",Media Go AWOL on Holding the Bidens Accountable,162,"  For the first two years of Joe Biden's presidency, the partisan Democrats of our ""legacy media"" treated the Pelosi-Picked Panel on Jan. 6 as a dominant story, worthy of hundreds of hours of television coverage, both live coverage of the hearings and breathless cycles of previews and reviews. Once Republicans took over the House, would we have predicted this kind of committee oversight coverage would go from Hero to Zero? On March 20, the House Oversight Committee held public hearings that were supposed to feature live testimony by Hunter Biden. The GOP-led committee titled the hearing ""Influence Peddling: Examining Joe Biden's Abuse of Public Office,"" which was already a turn-off for Biden-voter reporters. That night NBC offered two minutes. ABC and CBS did nothing. In January, Hunter Biden pulled a stunt by showing up and demanding a public hearing, and the networks covered that. On Feb. 28, Hunter showed up for a hearing behind closed doors, and the networks covered that. But when Hunter skipped the public hearing he allegedly wanted, they skipped the story? Even those prestigious national newspapers with the slogans about ""All the News That's Fit to Print,"" and ""Democracy Dies in Darkness"" offered a big fat zero in their print editions. Nothing on Joe Biden's abuse of office was published in The New York Times, The Washington Post or The Wall Street Journal. Then consider ""public"" broadcasting the ones who have automatic and undeserved prestige because of their ""for the people"" branding. The ""PBS NewsHour"" offered nothing, not 10 hot seconds. They offered eight minutes on a potential government shutdown, so their journalists were working on Capitol Hill. The taxpayer-funded hour also carried five minutes on the ""controversial"" Texas border-enforcement law, five minutes on the Biden administration setting a timeline for ending the gasoline-powered automobile, and almost seven minutes on a Mississippi police ""goon squad"" that brutalized some black men. ""Systemic racism,"" always a staple. National ""Public"" Radio was a bad joke, as in their show ""All Things Considered"" never considered a story on the Biden abuses office hearing. NPR's homepage was topped the next morning by their hot story: new details on Rupert Murdoch's British phone-hacking scandal of 2011. Their media reporter David Folkenflik files a hostile story on Murdoch or Fox News on a regular basis, like he was an operative being paid by MSNBC and CNN. NPR had a Biden mention on their homepage. Their young White House reporter Deepa Shivaram had a TikTok-like video shoot on President Biden grabbing a trendy boba tea in Las Vegas under the headline ""Food stops can tell you a lot about a campaign."" Shilling Shivaram cheerfully explained, ""Asian-Americans make up a critical voting bloc in Nevada,"" and ""Experts on food and politics say that Biden ordering this could also send a message to people who think he's too old for the job."" I scrolled all the way down the homepage looking for a Biden-hearing story, to no avail. At the very bottom, there was this news from the insect world: ""Scientists studied how cicadas pee. Their insights could shed light on fluid dynamics."" This makes it easy to describe the quality of NPR's coverage of the Biden family scandals. It's a warm bucket of cicada urine.

"February 6, 2024",Meghan Trainor's Adorable New Video of Baby Barry Sparks Rude Comments from Mom-Shamers,163,"  Another day, another baby getting criticized by the internet. Yes, you read that right. A baby - specifically, Meghan Trainor and Daryl Sabara's infant son Barry - is getting picked apart, and we are so tired of the audacity of mom-shamers. (Paris Hilton is all too familiar with this narrative.) The ""Made You Look"" singer recently posted an adorable new TikTok of her 7-month-old, and some people couldn't resist being mean in the comments. Precious Baby @meghantrainor The way he looks at us at the end @darylsabara #ithinkilikethislittlelife #littlelife Little Life - Cordelia First, let's check out the video in question, which Trainor captioned: ""The way he looks at us at the end ."" In the TikTok, Trainor and Sabara sit on either side of Barry, who is happily playing in a baby activity center. While he's distracted by the bright toys on the tray in front of him, Trainor whisper-sings, ""I think I like this little life"" from ""Little Life"" by Cordelia. He turns and looks at his mom and reaches up to touch her face, and it's so sweet! The Spy Kids alum takes a turn singing the line, and Barry just turns and looks at him before looking back at the camera, clearly unimpressed. By the end of the short video, he's leaned into his mom again, grabbing her hair and looking absolutely adorable. The Comments Meghan Trainor at The 2023 Streamy Awards held at the Fairmont Century Plaza Hotel on August 27, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Christopher Polk/Penske Media via Getty Images) Because people are so rude, though, they filled the comments with annoying remarks on baby Barry's head. ""HIS HEAD TUMMY TIME,"" one person rudely wrote. Another diagnosed him, ""think the little one has plagiocephaly, my daughter was about his age when she finally got diagnosed, still has it, she suffers with bad migraines."" ""rn here. it's helmet time ?"" someone else said, as if adding a heart was enough to excuse an uncalled-for opinion on a baby. Another said, ""Have yall thought about a helmet for the shape of his head? My little wore a helmet and his head was shaped the same!"" Please! Just let them make a cute video of their baby without fielding all these invasive comments about their son. If there were a concern, we're sure they will discuss it with their own doctor. Happy Family THE KELLY CLARKSON SHOW - Episode J055 - Pictured: (l-r) Daryl Sabara, Meghan Trainor - (Photo by: Weiss Eubanks/NBCUniversal via Getty Images) Trainor and Sabara are also parents to son Riley, who turns 3 this month. The ""Mother"" singer opened up about the brothers' sweet relationship in a recent interview with PEOPLE. ""He loves him,"" she said about Riley and Barry. ""And Barry doesn't have this reaction with anyone else, but when Riley's over him and smiling at him, Barry freaks out and starts laughing and looks at him already like, 'You're my hero.' I'm like, 'I wish Barry looked at me like that!' He's obsessed with Riley."" They are the cutest, happiest family - and they definitely don't need to worry about the opinions of mom-shamers!

"March 1, 2024",Meghan Trainor's Cryptic New TikTok Is Making Everyone Think She's Pregnant with Baby No. 3,165,"  Rumors are swirling that Meghan Trainor is pregnant with baby number 3 - and they were started by the pop star herself. The ""Hands on Me"" singer shared a cryptic new TikTok that have many fans convinced she is expecting. New TikTok LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - NOVEMBER 08: Meghan Trainor attends Spotlight: Meghan Trainor at The GRAMMY Museum on November 08, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Rebecca Sapp/Getty Images for The Recording Academy) In the video, Trainor is all dressed up for a photoshoot in a silver sparkly outfit. Her makeup is done and a hairstylist is curling her long blonde hair. Text written over the TikTok reads: ""POV: Looking up if I'm pregnant every time I'm one day late and my husband asks what I'm doing."" Trainor lip-synchs to a popular sound that plays in the background. In it, someone asks, ""What are you doing?"" and Trainor mouths back with the response: ""Texting."" ""Texting who?"" the voice asks. ""My sister,"" she responds. In the caption, Trainor tagged her husband Daryl Sabara. ""JUST CHECKING @darylsabara."" @meghantrainor JUST CHECKING @darylsabara  original sound - girls - girls Hmm ... Is she checking if she's pregnant because she's trying to get pregnant? Is she already pregnant and this is her way of hinting at it? Is it just a joke designed to make us crazy?! It's hard to say, but fans are convinced this is her way of soft-launching her pregnancy news. Fans Are Convinced ""Is this a hint to baby #3"" one person asked. Someone else commented, ""Praying for a mini Megan ."" ""Well u and ur hubby make beautiful babies, so it wouldn't be awful! ,"" another commented. ""No bc every time I was one day late I WAS PREGNANT ,"" someone else warned. Four Kids Although Trainor hasn't confirmed (or denied!) the rumors, she has opened up previously about wanting four kids. The ""Mother"" singer is currently mom to son Riley, 3, and son Barry, 7 months, with Sabara. Before she announced her pregnancy with Barry, she told PEOPLE in Dec. 2022 that she wanted four kids. ""Hopefully, I'll be pregnant,"" she said about her hopes for the upcoming year. She continued, ""I'm trying to make four children, so I've got to get on it!"" Trainor went on, ""After having a baby, I was like, there's nothing I can't do. So now I'm just trying to knock off all my dreams on my dream list."" A month later, she shared a cute video of a prediction generator going over her head, which she prompts, ""OK, get pregnant."" She captioned the clip, ""I want another baby pls @darylsabara."" She gave birth to baby Barry later that year, so maybe the TikTok manifesting really works!

"March 9, 2024","Millie Bobby Brown Addresses Comments About Her Accent Changing: ""I'm Trying My Best""",166,"  Millie Bobby Brown is not here for the comments about how her accent has changed as she has spent more time in America.  The Stranger Things star sat down for an interview with internet personality Max Balegde and discussed the social media conversations surrounding the actress seemingly losing her British accent as she mostly lives in the United States now.  ""I'm an actor,"" Brown said. ""I grew up in the public eye. I grew up in America. I come to set, and I'm an actor and I adapt, and so I want to mimic other people!"" She explained the voices of the people she's around - like her fiancé Jake Bongiovi, Jon Bon Jovi's son - can and do impact how she speaks. But she pointed out that when she's in England, her natural accent comes out more.  ""I can't help that when I'm around my fiancé, or when I'm with people like Jimmy Fallon, who have a very American accent, I wanna replicate it!"" Brown concluded. ""And now I'm in England, I wanna replicate that [accent]! I don't do it intentionally, and I'm sorry if it offends you, OK? But listen, I'm trying my best! I'm trying my best."" @max_balegde My favourite interview of all time. She was so sweet and she can talk however she wants!!!!

""Her british accent is barely there anymore,"" a user commented on a TikTok video at the time, while another one noted, ""she pronounces certain words like a brit but the cadence she's using is so american."" On the other hand, some users came to her defense, with one writing, ""People who have accents are often told to pronounce as much as possible to make it so other can understand them better.

"March 24, 2024","Mocktails, foot sprays and powders: Magnesium is having a moment; Influencers recommend mineral to help you sleep, focus, relax. It likely does more than you think but less than you hope.",167,"  Over dinner in Hollywood, a friend confides that she's spritzing it on the soles of her feet at night and getting ""the best sleep of my life."" At Erewhon in Silver Lake, a noticeably focused and relaxed employee tells me she stirs it into tea for focus and relaxation. In my TikTok feed, a woman tries to end her three-day battle with constipation by chugging it straight from the bottle. (Disclaimer: Don't.) Her giddy victory speech, full of graphic details that absolutely cannot be repeated here, has 27.8 million views and counting. All three of these people name the same ingredient as the key to their sweet relief -- not some newly patented molecule or ancient herbal extract but one of the most common elements on earth: magnesium.  After decades of middle-of-the-alphabet anonymity on vitamin store shelves, the humble metal suddenly is taking a star turn in the wellness community, popping up in thousands of posts and even inspiring its own viral recipe, the Sleepy Girl Mocktail. (Tart cherry juice and magnesium powder, with an optional ring light.) Since the online debut of that elixir on TikTok last year, Google searches for ""magnesium sleep"" have more than doubled, while combined mentions on several other platforms -- YouTube, X, Reddit, and Tumblr -- have jumped 87%, according to the social media analytics company Sprout Social. Magnesium's online success also has been spurred in part by a Cambrian explosion of products and formulations, each adapted for a different niche in the wellness ecosystem. At Alo Yoga in the Grove, you can pick up Magnesium Reset Spray for misting over tense muscles. (""It's our most popular wellness product,"" an employee there told me.) At Malibu Vitamin Barn, you can grab packs of ""Lypo-Spheric"" magnesium gel, perfect for squeezing into your morning latte. Erewhon sells more than 30 forms of magnesium, each claiming a different benefit: magnesium carbonate for healthy sleep, magnesium bisglycinate for stress relief, ozonated magnesium oxides for better digestion, magnesium L-Threonate for cognitive support -- the list goes on. A mere $250 will get you a massage supercharged with ""heat activated"" magnesium oil at the Conrad Hotel downtown. Financially speaking, the wellness industry has finally succeeded where centuries of alchemists failed: turning magnesium into gold. Total sales of the supplement in its myriad forms are projected to top $1.5 billion in 2024, according to the Nutrition Business Journal, and there are no signs of slowing down. ""In the last year, we've brought in a lot of new magnesium products, and it keeps gaining traction,"" said Maren Giuliano, VP of health and wellness at Erewhon, where sales of the supplement are up by more than 50% over last year. ""It's definitely hot right now."" In the wellness world, this isn't even magnesium's first moment in the sun. (Actually, all magnesium started out inside a sun, or rather, inside decaying supernovas where helium and carbon nuclei were fused by unimaginably powerful forces to form new atoms, some of which have had the honor of ending up in Goop's magnesium-rich Detoxifying Superpowder.) The first recorded magnesium craze started in 1618, when a farmer in the English town of Epsom noticed that his cows wouldn't drink from a bitter pool of water. Perhaps seeking some 17th-century form of clout, he decided to drink it himself. He quickly noticed the laxative effect for which Epsom salts would become world-famous, drawing hordes of stopped-up tourists to the town for decades to come. Over the years, the supplement has been ascribed many medical powers, some more credible than others. In 1934, the New York Times announced a breakthrough discovery by a Johns Hopkins professor who found that ""magnesium tends to sweeten the human disposition and that 'grouchiness' may be caused in part by the absence of this mineral salt in the system."" In our current magnesium moment, the supplement is being marketed as a miracle cure for just about everything from muscle cramps to insomnia. The promise that magnesium can soothe, ground and calm us -- like a gravity blanket for the mind -- is especially alluring in anxious times when prices are surging, wars fill the news and the embers of the pandemic are still smoldering. As a result, healthcare professionals are fielding a steady stream of questions from patients who are curious about what magnesium can do for them. The answer, according to experts interviewed for this article, could be summed up as: more than you might think, but less than you might hope. So, what is it good for? Biologically, your body can't run without magnesium. Unless you have a serious chronic illness, you probably have about 25 grams of it in you right now, mostly in your bones. ""Magnesium plays many essential roles in the body,"" said Dr. Zhaoping Li, director of UCLA's Center for Human Nutrition. ""It's part of the muscle relaxation process, it's involved in neurotransmitters. It is an essential part of all cell types. So as you can imagine, lacking it would have wide- spectrum negative impacts on health."" That doesn't mean you necessarily need to take magnesium supplements, though. While the USDA says that less than half of Americans get their daily recommended dose of magnesium from food, Dr. Li said that medically speaking, deficiency isn't common in otherwise healthy people. ""If anyone has a regular diet, this is not something you would easily lack. The source of magnesium [in food] is pretty wide."" As for magnesium's reputation as a slayer of stress and bringer of sleep, the jury is still out, according to Steven Chen, associate dean for clinical affairs at USC's Alfred E. Mann School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. ""The science is not extremely strong in this area,"" he said. ""But there are associations between magnesium supplementation and improvement in depression, improvement in anxiety, in migraine headaches. There are some research reports that suggest that's the case."" Still, magnesium success stories are increasingly easy to find. ""It's like night and day for some people,"" said Amanda Cohen, a doctor of Chinese medicine and owner of Sourcepoint Wellness in Atwater Village. ""They're like, 'I finally slept through the night.'"" Cohen has used magnesium in her practice for more than a decade because it has a large range of applications for patients and is generally well tolerated. ""It's already in our bodies, so we're just supporting it, whether it's through food or a small dose."" Despite their different backgrounds, the practitioners I spoke to all agree on a few points. First, supplemental magnesium isn't a cure-all, no matter how many social media posts may say otherwise. Second, you should consult a healthcare professional before starting any supplements to rule out harmful effects or interactions. (This is especially important for people with any kind of kidney impairment, since excess magnesium is flushed out in urine.) And finally, in sufficient doses, magnesium will almost certainly make at least one thing happen for you. ""Magnesium citrate is used before colonoscopies to really get the bowel going,"" said Dr. Li. Or, in Cohen's words, ""It can be verymoving."" Turns out the lady in the TikTok video wasn't wrong. Regardless, magnesium seems poised to stick around in wellness circles -- even in L.A., where new health trends arrive with the steady rhythm of ocean waves. When I dropped by Moon Juice in Venice on a clear January day, an employee gave me free samples of the company's new Magnesi-Om powders, which sprawl across nearly half a wall of display space. ""These are very calming, great for anxiety,"" she advised. ""And they come in different flavors, in case you don't like one."" A few minutes later, I walked up the street to an herbal apothecary that offers rose quartz crystals alongside dropper-bottle tinctures labeled ""Happiness."" When I asked if they sell anything with magnesium, an employee turned apologetic. ""No,"" she sighed. ""But I wish we did. It's amazing.""

"January 26, 2024",Molly Ringwald Says John Hughes Wrote 'Sixteen Candles' After Seeing Her Headshot,168,"  If it weren't for Molly Ringwald's headshot landing on John Hughes' desk, the world might have never seen the now-classic film Sixteen Candles. During an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Ringwald shared that she never had to audition for Hughes because their first collaboration was written with her in mind.  ""He had gotten my picture from a stack of headshots from ICM, and he just had it up on his wall, and he wrote Sixteen Candles over a weekend, looking at my picture,"" she told the late night host. ""So, when it was time to cast it, he cast the girl in the picture.""  Ringwald starred alongside Anthony Michael Hall in Hughes' 1984 film, before reuniting with both men for The Breakfast Club. The writer-director offered the actors the 1985 film when they finished filming Sixteen Candles, and the Riverdale actress said she immediately wanted to take on the part.  Not only did the cast rehearse for two or more weeks prior to production starting, but also they helped restructure the script after Hughes changed a lot of it by the time they were going to begin filming.  ""He was trying to please everyone, trying to please the studio and just kind of adding stuff,"" she recalled. ""There was a naked teacher in there at one point, swimming. And he said, 'Are you excited about doing this?' And I said, 'Yeah, I'm excited, but it's really different than it was, you know, when I agreed to do it.'""  The next day, he brought in a massive stack of papers and sat down with the cast. Together, they went through them all and shared what they felt should be kept, re-added or removed.  ""He was really collaborative,"" she continued. ""They were so well-written that we would always just kind of do it as written, and then he would say, 'Now just do what you want.'""

Through a community of devout regulars and an owner that embraces them, it's quietly become a drama-free, all-are-welcome place to dance from 9 p.m. until last call just before 2 a.m. No RSVP, no cover, no line outside. In the back of the L-shaped room, the bathroom line buzzes with strangers bonding over how they found Thai Angel and flexing how many times they've visited. It's the type of conversation you'd expect somewhere like Spotlight, a dress-to-impress nightclub that recently opened in Hollywood, or at an underground warehouse party in East L.A. or downtown. But some young L.A. partygoers are tired of corporate-feeling clubs and exclusive or ticketed events. They've gone back to basics -- favoring casual bar environments. Gen Z's recent discovery of 100-year-old Barney's Beanery has made the late-night roadhouse as hard to get into as the spots the new crowd was seemingly trying to avoid. Thai Angel has no glamorous Hollywood backstory or viral TikTok posts, yet its dance floor is packed. (Follow the club at instagram.com/thaiangelbar for event updates.) Jamie Eich, 58, opened the first iteration of Thai Angel, named after her daughter, in 1995 as a karaoke bar in Hollywood. Eight years ago, on her daughter Salanya ""Angel"" Inm's 21st birthday, Jamie asked what she wanted. ""A bar,"" she answered. The current Thai Angel location on Western Avenue was her birthday gift. Thai Angel is co-owned by Jamie, Angel and her brother Boss Inm, 36. After college, Angel, now 29, began working as a waitress and bartender. Boss and Jamie are behind the bar at Thai Angel every day. Angel, who also works as a reiki practitioner and model, is preparing to open an alcohol-free tea lounge upstairs. The family never set out to make Thai Angel a nightlife hot spot. Sure, it poured strong drinks and stayed open late, but the first DJs to throw parties in the space were just regulars slurping down pad see ew at the bar. Most people inside tonight found the space through a party called SOUP. In 2020, eight friends in the music industry, including Swedish pop star Tove Lo, were looking for a place to throw an informal DJ night. They looked for a venue across L.A. but couldn't find the right fit, eventually giving up and grabbing a late-night dinner. They ended up at Thai Angel. The first SOUP was days before the city issued pandemic stay-at-home orders in March 2020. The friends have since put on 13 events at the restaurant. Throwing dance parties at Thai Angel requires promoters to bring in their own DJ and speaker setup, but the environment is worth it. ""People have really responded to the unique feel of Thai Angel and the fun concept of SOUP's quick DJ rotation,"" says SOUP member Samuel Luria. ""The setting has a lot to do with it. L.A. nightlife is filled with things worth avoiding ... there are plenty of douchey clubs, trendy bars and overpriced and pretentious mixology. There are also fun spots where the owners have applied care and vision in order to create a fun and unique environment. Thai Angel is one of those spots."" On party nights, the eight friends arrive early to enjoy an off-menu vegan tom kha soup prepared by Jamie, with plenty of leftovers for the rest of the week. Tonight, the crowd at Thai Angel is courtesy of DJ collective Friends of Friends of Friends. Previously, they threw house parties and DJed the occasional wedding, but the trio was inspired by SOUP and began throwing events at Thai Angel last September. ""Jamie immediately welcomed us as her family,"" said co-founder Collin Sommers. ""For a city known for its glitz and glam, there's a lot of authenticity in the spaces below the surface. Thai Angel is just one story, amongst many in L.A., of a women-owned, family-owned business that truly foster community."" Jamie, who is a single mother, enjoys her role as welcoming committee and secondary mom to Thai Angel patrons. Some regulars don't know her first name and refer to her only as ""Mom."" She encourages it. A handwritten note tacked to the bar displays her username for digital payments as ""Thai-Mom."" The nickname was popularized by DJ and actor Ian Alexander Jr., who died by suicide at 26. Jamie credits him for throwing weekly DJ nights starting in 2018 that laid the foundation for Thai Angel to become an if-you-know-you-know nightlife spot. ""He loved doing it. He'd greet me with 'Hi, Mom, how are you?' He made this place pop. I think that he's still here with us,"" she said. Angel believes the family dynamic is responsible for the warm and welcoming environment. ""It's a very small, narrow space. It's cozy. In my mind it really does feel like a living room, a house party. People come here and they feel at home,"" she says. In addition to this spot, Jamie owns two bars in Bangkok, also named Thai Angel. ""We set goals here. Like Nike said, just do it,"" Jamie says. At midnight, a man bobs and weaves through the crowd holding a stack of giant pizza boxes. Jamie immediately waves him over to the last booth, where he begins giving out slices for free. Scotty Chappell, co-owner of Swizzle Pizza, an East Hollywood pop-up, has been coming to Thai Angel for seven years. He initially stumbled in while working at a restaurant down the street. Before opening Swizzle, Chappell and his business partners experimented with serving Thai pizzas out of the Thai Angel oven. ""Thai Angel has always been there for us. It's a chosen family in a city where that feels so hard to find. We're there for them too, whether it's helping them close up on busy nights, taking out the trash, washing dishes or bringing in a ton of pizza to feed a party so they can actually have a break from cooking their delicious Thai food,"" Chappell says. At 1 a.m., the dance floor shows no signs of slowing down. Jamie has changed into a ""I <3 Thai Angel"" T-shirt. Angel is passing out homemade lemon bars, courtesy of a regular who calls the bar their ""Cheers."" Across Los Angeles, the Saturday night crowd is waiting in line for a hot bar or racking up an Uber bill as they search for the next better party. If only they knew what was hiding in plain sight.

"January 22, 2024",North West Leaks Makeup-Free Photos of Kim Kardashian & We Have Questions,171,"  One of the things Kim Kardashian is best known for is the impossibly high beauty standards she sets. So it came as both a shock and a breath of fresh air when Kardashian's daughter North West ""leaked"" unedited, makeup-free photos of her mom on TikTok this weekend. The mother-daughter duo share an account and Kardashian supposedly gives the green light for everything her daughter posts. So we're surprised that the 10-year-old got away with posting those photos. What made Kardashian be suddenly OK with more than 614 million followers seeing the real her? The first shot came from a ""photo dump,"" on Friday, and the two seem to be on a Facetime call. Kardashian has wide eyes and is doing her signature pursed lips while North - who Kardashian shares with ex-husband Kanye ""Ye"" West - makes a silly face for the camera. The SKIMS founder doesn't seem to have a drop of makeup on, and it's a pretty refreshing sight to see. ""The things, my daughter makes on my phone ha ha ,"" Kardashian captioned the TikTok. On Sunday, North posted another photo dump. This one included a selfie of Kardashian and her 6-year-old daughter Chicago West. In this one, Kardashian's frown lines are clearly on display. The two shots prove that no one is always (or naturally) red carpet-ready and wrinkle-free. Kim Kardashian and North West (Photo by MEGA/GC Images) ""Such a good picture,"" North wrote over the photo with three laughing emojis. So we're once again wondering: where did this vulnerability come from? Did these somehow slip through the cracks? And how does it feel for Kardashian, who grew up being endlessly scrutinized by the public, to be bare-faced and seemingly unfiltered in front of the world? Perhaps she's been reflecting on something her step-sister Kylie Jenner said in an episode of The Kardashians. ""All of us just need to have a bigger conversation about the beauty standards that we're setting,"" she said. ""I wish I never touched anything to begin with."" She then said she doesn't want her daughter Stormi, 5, to enter the world of cosmetic and plastic procedures. It was reminiscent of a conversation she had with Homme Girls in April 2023. ""[Stormi is] perfect the way that she is,"" she told Homme Girls. ""I see my features in my daughter and my son now, but you know, my daughter looks like me. I get to see my beauty in her, and it's made me love myself more for sure."" Maybe that's the case for Kardashian. Maybe she's wanting to set a new standard for her kids - including sons Saint and Psalm West - where they know you don't have to change anything about the way you look to be beautiful and loved. There's nothing wrong with or embarrassing about showing yourself to the world without any edits. In fact, it's pretty damn empowering! If that is the case (and we hope it is), we tip our hats to the mom of four. Before you go, check out Kim Kardashian's best quotes about being a mom.

"January 29, 2024",North West Roasts Her Mom Kim Kardashian's Makeup Line in 'Honest Review' on TikTok,172,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. Last week, North West was focusing on anything but her mom's makeup, leaking makeup-free pictures of Kim Kardashian on their shared TikTok account. Now, her sole focus seems to be on her mom's newly launched cosmetic line from SKKN. The 10-year-old - who actually has an impressive knack for makeup - took a video where she conducted an ""honest review"" of the classic mattes eyeshadow palette, soft matte lip color (some shades have already sold out!), and lip liner (same!). North started things off with the eyeshadow, making swatches of each color on her arm. ""This is classic Kim,"" North said of the colors. ""This is what she would wear all the time."" CLASSIC MATTES EYESHADOW PALETTE $50 Buy Now from skkn Then she got started on a ""dramatic eye"" that we can't imagine Kim or the SKKN team was hoping she would go for. She haphazardly smeared black on both lids. ""This is just giving,"" she said before falling over laughing. Because it was giving ""yikes!"" She also showed off the lip liner and lip color, clearly picking ones that don't go together. ""This is so good, so good,"" she said. ""No words, no words."" The video is full of moments like that: North hilariously making the makeup look cringe while also saying ""nice"" (and maybe slightly sarcastic) things. ""You could wear this everywhere,"" she said, as her eyes continued to get more ""dramatic."" By the end, she looked like a member of Kiss. Again, we can't imagine the SKKN marketing team was too happy about this expert trolling. ""What my daughter does on my phone ha ha ha ha ha ha,"" Kardashian captioned the post, apparently not too offended by the roasting. @kimandnorth What my daughter does on my phone ha ha ha ha ha ha original sound - Kim and North Social Media Rules For North Kardashian is very mindful of North's social media usage and has strict rules about screen time and posting. Their joint TikTok account is only on Mom's phone - ""It's not something where she can scroll and look at things"" - and the comments are always turned off. Bye, trolls! ""The way that she is so creative, the way that she loves to do TikTok and do these videos, and she'll take my phone and do skincare stuff,"" Kardashian - who also shares kids Chicago, Saint, and Psalm with ex-husband Kanye West - said in Dec. 2022. ""She loves special effects makeup, so she'll be doing scars and faces and bullet wounds. She takes classes on it and that's what she loves to do so she loves to show it."" ""It makes her so happy,"" the TV personality continued. ""... She loves to do this stuff. I take it as more of a creative thing.""

"March 10, 2024","On 'SNL,' Scarlett Johansson satirizes Katie Britt and Josh Brolin recites poetry",174,"  Josh Brolin, the ""Avengers: Endgame"" actor riding high (on a worm, even!) on the success of his latest film ""Dune 2,"" proved a reliable ""Saturday Night Live"" host for the third time. Is he the most dynamic guest host ever to appear on the show? No. Is he the funniest? No, but he's clearly got a great sense of humor and a willingness to shed his vanity that goes a long way on a sketch show. In this outing, Brolin shed more than his vanity: in his monologue, he stripped down to his underwear and took a dip in an ice-filled tub to demonstrate his willingness to ""embrace the discomfort."" But it's likely a lot of people tuned in to the start of the show to see what ""SNL"" would do with the Republican party response to this week's State of the Union address. Before it had even concluded, social-media users speculated that ""Saturday Night Live"" would have plenty of fodder for a cold open from Alabama junior Sen. Katie Britt's kitchen-set speech. The only question was who would play her: It turns out the role went to Scarlett Johansson, who made a feast out of Britt's actorly line readings and her dramatic hand gestures. Brolin's parts on the show included a Viennese aristocrat obsessed with a shrimp tower (more on that below), a husband who tries to include bank robbers in the sexual escapades of his newly open marriage, and an airplane passenger watching ""Ad Astra"" who gets sucked into a song. He also played a member of a people pleaser's support group, a man who gets fixated on a cat at a wine and cheese party, a sad sub sandwich maker who is losing his office customers, a man in a wheelchair on a daytime talk show who is accused of cheating, and a dinner companion of Lisa from Temecula (Ego Nwodim). Musical guest Ariana Grande appeared in two sketches and performed ""We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)"" and ""Imperfect For You,"" which was introduced by her mother, Joan Grande. Notably, the singer didn't perform her latest single, ""Yes, And?"" which has received some online backlash. To no one's surprise, ""SNL"" drilled in on Britt's State of the Union response speech, which in only two days has been memed and parodied across TikTok and other social platforms. The cold open didn't start with her, but instead allowed Mikey Day a few laps as President Joe Biden, dunking on the Speaker of the House (""Mike Johnson shakes his head like he caught 30 seconds of the show 'Euphoria.'"") and pointing out that he should cede his time to Britt. ""I think she's gonna help me more than anything I can say here,"" Biden says. As Britt, Johansson was spot-on in her vocal fry and hand-acting the senator's mannerisms, saying, ""I'll be auditioning for the part of Scary Mom,"" and referring to herself as ""The craziest bitch in the Target parking lot."" The show referenced the ""strange empty kitchen"" where Britt delivered her response, saying, ""Republicans want me to appeal to women voters and women love kitchen."" The bad grammar was intentional. The ""SNL"" version of Britt pointed out that her shocking, left-turn story about sex trafficking was delivered out of context: ""Everything about it is real except the year, where it took place and who was president when it happened,"" Britt says. She also hawks jewelry, QVC-style in the bit, and decides she's going to talk in a way that is ""strangely seductive for no apparent reason."" Stirring tea led to a cutaway to a ""Get Out"" reference and concluded with the line: ""This isn't the last you'll see of Katie Britt. Maybe not in politics, but when you close your eyes, I'll be right there."" In his monologue, Brolin pointed out that the fortunes of musical guests he's been paired with have diverged quite a bit. The first, in 2008, was Adele before she was a gigantic superstar. The other was Gotye, whom Brolin joked is now ""someone I used to know."" Brolin made hay of the teasing he's gotten for writing a very strange poem about his ""Dune"" costar Timothée Chalamet. He said he wrote a new poem while working this week with Kenan Thompson. The poem refers to Thompson's ""sultry eyes"" and ""sugar cookie cheeks"" leading Brolin's feelings toward a ""symphony of desire to which I can only say ... what up with that?"" Brolin then took off his shirt and pants and dunked into his cold-plunge tub crying, ""I am inevitable!"" Best sketch of the night: A man must protect his shrimp tower The strangest sketch of the night was also the funniest: In a pre-taped piece that took place in 1893 Vienna, an aristocrat named Kinski has built an enormous, 20-foot-tall shrimp cocktail tower. Shrimp, he says, are the thinking man's mozzarella sticks. Kinski is also wooing an archduchess (Sarah Sherman) and hoping for her hand in marriage. But whenever she gets near the tower, threatening to make it collapse, he pushes her out of a window and does whatever he can to protect the shrimp masterpiece. The archduchess admires his protective instinct, but she can't save him, or the tower, from their inevitable fate. Also good: Bonus songs we missed in 'Moulin Rouge' On a PBS show about movies, host Ken Burnt (Day) explains that the Baz Luhrmann movie ""Moulin Rouge"" left a lot of songs on the cutting-room floor that were filmed in case the rights weren't secured for its multi-song medleys. Grande and Bowen Yang take on the Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman roles and sing the heck out of songs including TLC's ""Creep,"" U2's ""Pride (In the Name of Love),"" Jennifer Lopez's ""Waiting for Tonight"" and Shania Twain's ""Man! I Feel Like a Woman!"" and multiple instances of ""Happy Birthday,"" because that's an easy song to get the rights for. Consider this sketch a preview of Grande, who will inevitably guest host ""SNL"" in November when her movie ""Wicked"" comes out. 'Weekend Update' winner: More on Katie Britt, of course There were no guest bits on ""Weekend Update"" this week, but there was plenty for Colin Jost and Michael Che to work with between the State of the Union speech and response, Netflix's upcoming Mike Tyson fight, and the cancellation of the merger between JetBlue and Spirit Airlines. But, if Jost's wife playing Britt in the cold open wasn't enough, the ""Update"" co-host had a few more jokes, mocking the senator's whispery delivery and saying it's part of a new one-woman play called ""A Britt Much."" But the line that got the biggest response was about another senator: After showing a photo of Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who is retiring, in an orange dress with a big turquoise necklace, Che said she ""looks like all the Flintstones at once."" This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"April 4, 2024",One Tube of This Moisturizing Lip Tint Sells Every 10 Seconds & Shoppers Say It Has the 'Perfect My Lips but Better' Shade,175,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. I'll admit, when I hear that a product is so popular it sells every 10 seconds worldwide, I'm going to be interested. After all, it must be good and clearly doing something right to get people shopping for it. That's even more so when it's a beauty product. That's exactly the case here with Peripera's Ink Mood Glowy Tint.  Now, you may be familiar with the K-beauty brand's other famous lip product, which went viral on TikTok for its gorgeous, highly-pigmented lip stains that last all day. While the Ink Mood Glowy Lip Tint just launched in 2023, it's already super popular among K-beauty fans around the world that one tube sells every 10 seconds globally. That's pretty amazing. Not only that, it's less than $10, making it an affordable buy as well.  The Peripera Ink Mood Glowy Tint was made to provide your lips with glossy color all day, while keeping it moisturized as well. It contains ingredients such as lily and witch hazel extract to help smooth texture and soothe dry, chapped lips. Although it goes on glossy, it's also part lip tint so it fades down to color that stays all day. Per the brand, the color ""hugs and adheres to your exact contours,' leading to its incredible staying power. You also don't have to worry about it being sticky like the average lip gloss.  There are currently 16 shades to choose from, you're sure to find one that you love. But one shade in particular has really gotten the attention from fans for being the ""perfect my lips but better"" shade.  Peripera Ink Mood Glowy Lip Tint - Rose in Mind $10 Buy Now ""IT'S LITERALLY THE PERFECT MLBB!"" wrote one reviewer. ""I would so recommend to people with pigmented lips. It's such a pretty color, nice formula and has a nice scent. It's perfect, definitely getting more colors!""  Not only does the Peripera Ink Mood Glowy Tint sell really well, it's leaving shoppers super impressed. One shopper who became an instant fan wrote, ""Many luxury American lip tints and long-lasting lipsticks have repeatedly left me disappointed, and often end up looking bad on the lips after eating and drinking, as well as being incredibly drying. Not so with the Peripera lippie! On initial application, it goes on glossy and has tremendous staying power with the gloss stain. After eating and drinking, I find it's barely faded, if at all, and doesn't leave any weird missing patches. Lips stay kissed with color, and I find my lips never look dry with this on ... Also, worth mentioning is that the color is buildable which is totally nice. It's easy to see why this is a favorite among many Korean actors. So impressed with this magic in a tube! Get it!"" Another reviewer gave it a 10 out of 10 writing, ""Tried out sooo many (Dior, Lancôme, Marc Jacobs) to find the right tint, gloss, hydration and longevity - and this is it!"" Considering this can save you t least $20 on those high-end brands, it's a really great buy.  Finally, one reviewer who rarely ever finishes products, loved it so much, they've reordered Peripera's Ink Mood Glowy Tint multiple times. ""I usually never even go through a whole tube of lip balm but this one I have used up and bought more than three times already,"" they wrote. ""I really love it because it lasts all day long. [The Cherry So What shade] looks brighter red in the morning and by the end of the day just looks like a more natural red tinge. I also love it because it keeps my lips from getting dry."" Once again, there are 16 shades to choose from for just $10 a piece. If you want to see what all the hype is about, be sure to check it out on Amazon today.

"March 2, 2024",Past victories to protect queer kids didn't save Nex Benedict,178,"  The name Pat Logue may not be familiar to many of us, but her work is. From establishing the right of same-sex parents to adopt children to challenging the merits of the military's ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, it's not an exaggeration to say Logue's accomplishments as a lawyer for Lambda Legal were instrumental in changing the way society treats LGBTQ+ people. She died last week. It is because of Logue's work that the family of Nex Benedict may get some iota of justice. Nex was the nonbinary 16-year-old in Oklahoma who died in February one day after a group of students beat them up in a school restroom. One of Logue's landmark victories -- Nabozny vs. Podlesny in 1996 -- was the first legal challenge to antigay violence in public schools. Jamie Nabozny had been tormented for years at his Wisconsin high school for being gay. That would include being beaten up in the restroom. He sued his former district for refusing to do anything to stop the attacks. Officials were not only aware of the abuse Nabozny faced but also reportedly told him that ""boys will be boys"" and that he should expect the bullying because he was gay. After the verdict, Nabozny was awarded $1 million. More important, school districts around the country were put on notice: Every student -- regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity -- deserves a safe learning environment. Nex Benedict did not get that. Instead, the student faced an environment very similar to the one Nabozny encountered 25 years earlier. An environment our courts have already ruled was unacceptable. An environment that may have cost Nex their life. Police body-cam video shows Nex on a gurney after the attack in school. The details of their death the following day are murky, and an official cause of death has yet to be made public. But the history of abuse leading up to the death is clear. Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.) has already called for a federal investigation into Nex's death. Vice President Kamala Harris posted on social media: ""to the LGBTQI+ youth who are hurting and are afraid right now: President Joe Biden and I see you, we stand with you, and you are not alone."" This week Lambda Legal joined 350 other local, state and national organizations in an open letter calling for the removal of Oklahoma's state superintendent of public instruction, Ryan Walters. In the letter, Walters is accused of creating an environment in Oklahoma schools hostile to LGBTQ students, which the organizations say led to the attack on Nex. ""In the weeks following Nex's death, numerous youths have come forward to detail the rampant harassment of Oklahoma's 2SLGBTQI+ students by peers, teachers, and administrators,"" the letter reads, using an abbreviation that includes the Indigenous term ""two spirit"" to refer to some nonbinary individuals. ""We are outraged that a climate of hate and bigotry has been not only allowed to thrive, but encouraged by the person who is responsible for education in the state."" In addition to Walters' anti-trans rhetoric, he appointed a conservative social media influencer to the state's library board after that person harrassed educators online who were supportive of LGBTQ+ students. Walters dismissed the open letter as a ""standard tactic of the radical left"" adding, ""they will stop at nothing to destroy the country and our state."" And yet it was Walters -- not the ""radical left"" -- who appointed an anti-LGBTQ TikTok pseudo-celebrity to his state's library board, someone who didn't even live in Oklahoma and whose anti-gay social media posts incited bomb threats against school libraries accused of containing books that refer to gay people. Walters should never have been entrusted with overseeing the education and safety of children, and now that the mistake has been made and the damage done, I hope he will be swiftly removed and replaced by someone with an agenda to protect the learning environment. Whether or not the state replaces him, a civil suit against the district where Nex attended school, in the Tulsa suburb of Owasso, seems likely. There's also the question of holding those who attacked Nex accountable. In a statement to ABC News, the victim's family said: ""The Benedicts know all too well the devastating effects of bullying and school violence, and pray for meaningful change wherein bullying is taken seriously and no family has to deal with another preventable tragedy."" That's why Nabozny said he sued his school district in the 1990s: to prevent other queer kids from being targeted in school the way he was. That is also supposed to be a part of local and state administrators' jobs. In the past, gross failures to protect queer children might have been normal and tolerated. Certainly they had few repercussions. Thanks to Logue, that part of the story has changed. Queer kids are still targeted in school. However, instead of accepting the premise of ""boys will be boys,"" there's hope for accountability. -- @LZGranderson Graphic    PHOTO: HONORING Nex Benedict, 16, who was beaten in a school bathroom and died.

"February 27, 2024",PERSPECTIVES; Justices ponder regulation of social media; Most of court appear to agree Texas and Florida laws would violate free-speech rights of companies.,179,"  The Supreme Court sounded divided Monday during arguments on whether Florida and Texas can regulate popular social media sites and impose heavy fines on those who discriminate against conservatives or ""deplatform"" prominent Republicans, as happened to former President Trump after he continued to spread false claims about the 2020 election. The court's conservatives were split on whether deplatforming, or removing a user from a platform for violating the site's rules, was a protected editorial choice or ""censorship"" by a big tech company. And all of the justices said they were uncertain whether they could or should strike down these new laws entirely or perhaps rule more narrowly on certain provisions. The cases have drawn intense interest because neither Congress nor the high court had decided on how the government can regulate these popular platforms. During Monday's argument, most of the justices appeared to agree that the two states' laws would violate the free-speech rights of Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and others if the social media companies were punished for removing content they deemed objectionable or false. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Brett M. Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett said the 1st Amendment prohibits the government from restricting the editorial decisions of a private company, including websites. When a lawyer defending Florida's law said the state was simply trying to protect free speech in politics, Kavanaugh interrupted him, noting that the 1st Amendment says the government does not have the authority to decide which speech is appropriate. ""You left out what I understand to be three key words in the 1st Amendment -- by the government,"" Kavanaugh told Florida state solicitor Henry Whitaker. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. disagreed, saying the two states were defending free speech against ""censorship."" Thomas said the social media sites act as ""common carriers"" for speech, similar to telephone companies, and he disputed they were engaged in ""expressive"" activity protected by the 1st Amendment. ""What's the expressive conduct when Twitter deplatforms someone?"" he asked. ""Can you give me one example of a case in which we have said the 1st Amendment protects the right to censor?"" he asked at another point. Alito said the social media sites refer to ""content moderation"" but they were in fact engaging in censorship. ""Some may want to resist the Orwellian temptation to recategorize offensive conduct in seemingly bland terms,"" he said. Kavanaugh spoke up to disagree. He said author George Orwell wrote about an all-powerful state that controlled speech, not private companies. ""When I think of Orwellian, I think of the state, not the private sector,"" he said. The outcome in the case appeared uncertain, however. Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Neil M. Gorsuch said they were not prepared to strike down the Florida law entirely. ""This law is broad. It could apply to all sorts of things,"" Jackson said, including email messages. The justices spent much of their time discussing how and whether they could rule on parts of the laws that affect only the social media provisions. The Florida and Texas laws under review arose from complaints three years ago that Trump had been discriminated against or unfairly blocked by social media sites, including Twitter. In 2021, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed his state's first-in-the-nation law and said it targeted the ""Big Tech censors"" who ""discriminate in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley ideology."" The measure, adopted before billionaire Elon Musk purchased Twitter and changed its name to X, applies to social media sites with more than $100 million in annual revenue or more than 100 million users. It authorizes lawsuits for damages for ""unfair censorship"" and large fines if a social media site ""deplatforms"" a candidate for office. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott signed a somewhat broader bill months later, saying ""conservative speech"" was being threatened. It says a social media platform with more than 50 million users in the U.S. ""may not censor ... or otherwise discriminate against expression"" of users based on their viewpoint. NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Assn. sued to challenge both laws on free-speech grounds, and both laws were put on hold, including by a 5-4 order from the Supreme Court. The 1st Amendment clash revolves around a dispute over how to characterize these popular and profitable sites. Are they private companies like a newspaper or a bookstore with full free-speech rights to decide what material to include or exclude? Or as Thomas has insisted, are these online platforms more properly described as ""common carriers,"" like a telephone company with a legal duty to carry all speech and discriminate against none? Last year, the California Legislature adopted a measure to prohibit online companies from collecting and selling data on children and teens, but it was blocked on 1st Amendment grounds by a federal judge in San Jose. The state's appeal is now before the 9th Circuit Court. The Biden administration is also facing suits from several Republican states for allegedly pressuring social media sites to remove ""disinformation"" on the dangers of COVID-19 vaccines. The Supreme Court will hear that case next month. The two federal appeals courts in the South, speaking through Trump appointees, have taken opposite stands on the free-speech issue. Judge Kevin Newsom, speaking for the 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta, blocked most of Florida's law from taking effect on the grounds it was unconstitutional. Judge Andrew Oldham, speaking for the 5th Circuit Court in New Orleans, upheld the Texas law on the grounds the state sought to protect the free-speech rights of Texans.

"March 15, 2024",Peso Pluma ends SXSW showcase with a heated message to haters: 'Keep talking',180,"  Peso Pluma paced across the stage to the sounds of uproarious applause. His set was coming to a close, but there was something he needed to get off his chest. ""Every single one of us,"" he told the crowd in Spanish, gesturing to his band behind him, ""continue to make music for you all. And as long as I am alive, my team and I will continue to rock each stage, no matter what happens."" The 3,000 attendees - many of whom had waited hours in line to see the Mexican singer on Wednesday - cheered in response at Austin City Limits at the Moody Theater, which hosted Rolling Stone's South by Southwest Future of Music showcase. ""We will keep representing our Mexican flag wherever we can. To social media and the press, keep talking,"" he continued, adding in English: ""Keep talking motherf-."" The 24-year-old then used a Spanish expletive to refer to his lack of care for external commentary and opinions. ""Que viva los corridos,"" he said in Spanish: ""Long live the corridos."" The speech came after Pluma decried ""all the controversy,"" without referring to a particular incident. The musician topped off his performance with ""Lady Gaga,"" a track about living a lavish lifestyle. He then embraced his band onstage, taking off as the crowd chanted for an encore.  The past year has seen Pluma's star power exponentially grow since the release of the ballad ""Ella Baila Sola,"" with Eslabon Armado. He has also released an album, ""Genesis,"" and has more new music in the works. The last months, however, have also been met with controversies. In September, the Guadalajara-born musica Mexicana artist canceled a concert in Tijuana after receiving death threats by a drug cartel. A January performance in Chile was lambasted by Chilean government officials and public figures, who condemned Pluma's alleged glorification of narco culture. The next month, Nicki Nicole, the Argentinian singer Pluma had introduced as his girlfriend, shared a post alluding to their breakup over infidelity rumors, according to People. Nonetheless, Pluma, born Hassan Emilio Kabande Laija, has marched on, reaching milestone after milestone, such as being the first musica Mexicana artist to grace the cover of Rolling Stone. ""I'm grateful to my people and to fans who supported me because they're the ones that have put us on the charts and everything else,"" he told the magazine. ""But I don't see this as a competition or about position or about places we've reached. I think it's not just Peso Pluma that reached Number One - it's Mexican music that made this happen."" Regional Mexican music has surged in popularity with younger artists bringing their own touches to the genre, which has also taken off on TikTok. Last year, the genre grew 60% in audio streams, according to the Associated Press. On Wednesday, Pluma made time to meet with a fan who had stood in line since 4 a.m. to see him hit the stage in Austin. Backstage, he autographed a photo and took photos, with the fan noting that he was headed to Chicago to see him perform next. ""From here on out, you won't pay for any ticket,"" Pluma told him in footage posted to social media. ""Wherever you want to go, you'll have a ticket there."" Artists such as Pluma, who performed that night along with Young Miko, Kevin Kaarl, J Noa and Pink Pablo, are emblematic of the cultural zeitgeist right now, according to Rolling Stone Chief Executive Gus Wenner.  ""Ultimately, that's the goal - to put people on stage that actually resonate with our generation today,"" he said. This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

In a now-viral video that has racked up nearly 9,000 comments, she laid out the convo - and opened it up to the laments of oldsters everywhere. ""The other day, my daughter told me the names Ashley or Amanda - or my name is Amber - are like old people names,"" she revealed, effectively blowing our minds. ""She's like, 'Yeah, my teacher's names are like, Ms. Erica, Ms. Samantha. There are Amandas and Ashleys,'"" Cimiotti said. ""She's like, 'Those are just old people names.'"" These vintage names are so dang adorable! https://t.co/qtM6X9lFC5 - SheKnows (@SheKnows) August 30, 2023 When I think of Ashleys, I think of the perky, popular blonde I aspired to be in junior high. But apparently when the kids of today think of Ashleys, they think of someone who is less ""junior high"" and more ""senior living."" They see Jessica and Erica in the same way as we saw Phyllis, Debbie, Sharon, and Cindy: people who are our parents' age, which is - from a kid's perspective - old as hell. One commenter brought late-'90s musical phenomenon Lou Bega into the mix: ""If you got a shout out in Mambo Number 5, congrats you now have a granny name lol."" A deflating realization: I remember jamming gleefully to that song, probably while wearing my Steve Madden slip-on platforms, singing extra-loud during the part that mentions my name. Sob. Sadly, they're not wrong; the female names mentioned in ""Mambo No. 5"" were - in order of appearance - Angela, Pamela, Sandra, Rita, Monica, Erica, Tina, Sandra, Mary, and Jessica. And I'm pretty sure all of us need eye cream ... if not Dentu-Creme.  Per the U.S. Social Security Administration, which tracks baby name data and releases a list of the top 1000 most popular names every year, Jennifer, Jessica, Ashley, Amanda, and Brittany were among the top five most popular names given to girls born between 1980-1990. Which means those girls are now in their mid-thirties to mid-forties. Which means that when the kids of today grow up, these will indeed be the names of the little old ladies in front of them doing 25 mph in a 45-mph zone.  Still, other TikTok users pointed out that the popular names parents are giving their kids now - names like Alice, Frankie, Evelyn, and Florence - were the ""grandma"" and ""grandpa"" names of our day. ""Little do they know we just repurposed old people names lol,” said one commenter. Such is the nature of baby naming, and there's even a term for this phenomenon: it's been dubbed the ""Hundred-Year Rule."" Basically, the most popular names from any decade will experience a resurgence in popularity in almost exactly 100 years, and you can look to today's hot names as proof. We'll use Hattie, for example; 100 years ago, in 1924, it was #149 on the SSA's list of most popular girl names. It dropped off the charts completely in 1968, but it has rebounded with a vengeance - and as of the most recent count, was at #411 and rising. Like everything else (Steve Madden platform slides, anyone?), names go in and out of fashion. We will accept, if a little grudgingly, that we now have ""old people names."" But we'll have the last laugh when, somewhere down the line, we're introduced to our great-granddaughter ... Erica Ashley. From Afton to Whitney, here are a few perfectly posh and preppy names for your baby girl.

"February 16, 2024",Prince William Said He Was Left 'Cringing' Over This Taylor Swift Interaction in a Resurfaced Video,185,"  Prince William is probably blushing after a video of a moment he later labeled as ""cringe"" has gone viral on TikTok over 10 years later. A video of The Prince of Wales belting out a song during an impromptu karaoke session with Taylor Swift and Jon Bon Jovi has left first-time viewers slack-jawed. According to Newsweek, the hilarious moment took place on November 26, 2013 during the Centrepoint Gala Dinner in London, a fundraising event for a homelessness charity of which William is a patron. At the event, William and other attendees watched Bon Jovi perform his hit ""Livin on a Prayer"" with some A-list help from Swift but, unexpectedly, the performers decided they needed some royal assistance.  @stephanieecaleffo melhor trio ever Kkk @Taylor Swift @Taylor Nation @Bon Jovi #taylorswift #principewilliamdegales #bonjovi #taylorswifttiktok #bonjovitiktok #edits #familiareal #viralvideotiktok #viralvideotiktok #viralmoments #tiktokvira #2014vibes #2015vibes #princewilliamedit #princewilliamofwales #taylornation13 #taylorswiftbr #rolealeatorio #aleatorio #melhortrio #melhorrole #swiftie #swiftietok #swiftiesoftiktok #swiftiesforever #swiftiecheck #melhorfesta #edits #vaiproforyou #vaiprafy #bestedit #vaiparaofycarambaaaa #iconico #iconicmoments #iconic #bonjovitok #bonjovitok #bonjovimoment #livinonaprayer #therealfamily #taylorswiftmoments #livinonaprayerbonjovi #taylorswiftswiftie som original - Stephanie Caleffo William reflected on the moment while appearing on Apple Fitness+'s Time to Walk podcast in December 2021. ""To this day, I still do not know what came over me,"" he said. He explained that he arrived to the event with no knowledge that the famous musicians would be performing, let alone expecting him to join in. ""I turn up and Jon Bon Jovi and Taylor Swift are at the event, which nearly knocked me off my feet,"" he said. ""And then I went inside, met everybody, a lot of handshaking to do these nights, a lot of chatting. I try and be charming and interactive."" ""When I sat down to watch Jon Bon Jovi do his performance, I thought: 'That's it. My job is done. I'll get a dinner in a minute and I might be able to have a chat to some people and, you know, I'm off-duty a little bit now,'"" he added. However, before he knew it, he was being dragged on stage. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's use of their titles on their new website has sparked controversy. https://t.co/G4eumalp45 - SheKnows (@SheKnows) February 15, 2024 ""Honestly, even now I'm cringing at what happened next, and I don't understand why I gave in. But, frankly, if Taylor Swift looks you in the eye, touches your arm, and says, 'Come with me...' I got up like a puppy and went, 'Yeah, OK, that seems like a great idea. I'll follow you.'"" Despite his embarrassment about the moment, William hinted that it taught him a valuable lesson about learning to let go. ""I think we've got to the stage in this life where we do micromanage ourselves,"" he explained. ""We do worry about: how do we look on social media? Who said what about me? What am I wearing? There's so many pressures, but I think that making a fool of yourself is OK."" ""It's OK to not take yourself too seriously and have those moments where you let go and you just go: Do you know what?

"February 13, 2024",Randi Mahomes Gives Tour of Son Patrick Mahomes' Childhood Home & Baby Photos Prove Bronze Is His Dad's Twin,187,"  That's right, folks! If you've been wondering what the childhood bedroom of a three-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback looks like, your prayers have been answered. Randi Mahomes, mom of Patrick Mahomes, walked through her house - the same one where Patrick grew up - with Got It From My Momma podcast host Jennifer Vickery Smith. The show shared the video on TikTok yesterday, and there are so many incredible highlights. The tour started in the entryway which (understandably) has several pieces of memorabilia hanging on the wall. There's a photo of Patrick from a feature in Texas Football, as well as his framed college jersey. Those things makes sense. That was expected. What we were not expecting to see was a mannequin wearing a Super Bowl hat and the signed T-shirt Travis Kelce wore at the NFL Pro Bowl. ""We do have Travis over here,"" Randi said, walking over to the freaky addition to the foyer. ""He gave this to my daughter ... That's just kind of been here. My girlfriends love it."" ""He scared me a little when I walked in here, I'm not gonna lie,"" Smith said. ""I know, he scares everybody,"" Randi agreed. Family PhotosSuper Bowl LVIII: Kansas City Chiefs Patrick Mahomes (15) poses with wife Brittany Mahomes and their children Patrick Bronze and Sterling Skye following victory vs San Francisco 49ers at Allegiant Stadium. (Photo by Erick W. Rasco/Sports Illustrated via Getty Images) The pair then walked into a room filled with family photos, and what was even more astounding than the scary (yet endearing?!) Kelce mannequin was the photo of baby Patrick. Because WOW! He looks just like his 1-year-old son Bronze Mahomes. They both have the same chubby cheeks and curly hair (psst! Randi! Did you use this leave-in conditioner on Patrick like your daughter-in-law Brittany Mahomes does with Bronze?).  And while Bronze can be known for giving some serious side eye (whether he be sitting with Santa or ""celebrating"" a Super Bowl win), he has also been known to flash heart-melting smiles like the one Patrick has in that sweet photo. We can't wait to see if the little guy continues to look more and more like his dad (is that even possible?!) as he grows up. Randi also has a picture from Bronze's ethereal newborn photoshooton display which she said Brittany got her for Christmas. And now we have to wonder if this proud grandma will print out what we think is the best photo from this year's Super Bowl. It's a magical shot of Patrick and his 2-year-old daughter Sterling Mahomes smiling up at the confetti that was falling after the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers. ""This pic is priceless i love it so much ?,"" Randi commented after her son shared it on Instagram. More Of The Tour LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - FEBRUARY 08: Randi Mahomes and Mia Randall attend the 13th annual NFL Honors (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images) Randi then took Smith to Patrick's childhood bedroom, which has since been taken over by his 12-year-old half-sister Mia Randall. It's where she plays games and displays her prized jersey collection. Then followers saw Mia's actual bedroom, which had two custom Super Bowl jackets hanging up. When asked if Randi would wear the adult one, she said she wasn't sure, since her daughter is going through a classic tween phase: ""Mia doesn't want us to dress alike,"" she explained. Next up? A look at Patrick's very. impressive. high school letter jacket. ""OK, I don't know if I've ever seen so many letters on a letter jacket,"" Smith admitted. Because the back and arms are covered in patches. ""I always want to wear it to something. Like a red carpet or something,"" Randi said. ""But it's so big and so heavy."" No way are we accepting those excuses, Randi! Now we have to see that on the carpet. It's the perfect look for the mom of a football legend.

The Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser has a bold name and makes big promises, but according to Amazon reviewers (and celebs), it actually delivers. Maybelline boasts that it can turn back time (at least temporarily), and reviewers agree. For context, if a product has 2,000 ratings on Amazon, that's generally considered good. Maybelline's under-eye concealer has a stunning 200,000 ratings and a 4.4-star rating. Now, as for Frankel, she shouted out this ""really good"" concealer back in April 2023. And per People, this was the concealer Reba McEntire wore to the 2024 Super Bowl. The under-eye concealer is infused with Haloxyl, which are peptides that brighten your skin and thicken it. Think about how thin the skin of your under-eye area is, and that ingredient makes perfect sense in a concealer. Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Erase Image: Maybelline. Buy: Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser $8.80, originally $10.99 This reviewer had tried many luxurious, higher-end concealers-$20-30-to try to obscure her dark circles and found this drugstore pick did the job much better. ""This little gem is great,"" She wrote. ""I use this concealer every day instead of all my high-end brand concealers. It's full coverage, buildable, lasts all day, not drying and not too liquidy. I'm so happy I gave this a try, will definitely be keeping this baby in my every day makeup bag."" Another shopper added that this is a ""failproof fixer,"" saying, ""I don't wear a lot of makeup but a concealer sure comes in handy for a quick fresher look, especially after Covid... I give it a 5 star rating without hesitation."" A third shopper we're going to mention simply said: ""Over 60 & this product takes YEARS off!""So of course, we were intrigued and we saw they said, ""I've always had dark under eye circles and it's always a challenge to find a concealer that covers it. This product works like no other PLUS softens and smooths fine lines and wrinkles! Lasts all day... LOVE IT!!!"" Another shopper called them ""Smooth & magical,"" saying, ""This is the good stuff!! I'm over 60 & I have wrinkles on top of wrinkles. A lot of concealers get into those creases & I'm looking like a cheap hook... err clown. This is the creamiest & smoothest I have ever used. Highly recommended!!"" The concealer even has a special cushion tip to ensure that you get a streak-free look. This concealer isn't only for under-eyes either, if you need to hide a blemish, erase some redness or blur a few fine lines, you can use this same product. Many makeup enthusiasts on TikTok use this concealer to contour. It normally costs $10.99, but right now some shades are as low as $8, so it's definitely worth adding this fan-favorite product to your cart. This concealer comes in 16 different shades, so you should be able to find the perfect match to your skin tone. In addition to the skin-tone-colored concealers, there are Brightener and Neutralizer options if you need a little extra help.

"March 27, 2024",Rebel Wilson Details Mistreatment Allegations From Set of 'The Brothers Grimsby'; Sacha Baron Cohen Denies Claims,189,"  Days after Rebel Wilson spoke out about Sacha Baron Cohen being an ""asshole"" who threatened her for mentioning his alleged mistreatment in her upcoming memoir Rebel Rising, People magazine shared an excerpt from the book with the relevant chapter.  The Pitch Perfect star wrote that she and Baron Cohen first met at a dinner party in 2013. He then asked her to appear as his character's girlfriend, Dawn Grobham, in the 2016 comedy The Brothers Grimsby, which besides starring in, Baron Cohen also co-wrote and produced. ""It felt like every time I'd speak to SBC, he'd mention that he wanted me to go naked in a future scene, I was like, 'Ha, I don't do nudity, Sacha,'"" recalled Wilson from her time on set with the multihyphenate. Wilson wrote that while filming at a soccer stadium in Cape Town, Baron Cohen had a production assistant tell the actress she was needed to film an additional scene. When they were filming it, he allegedly ""pulls his pants down...SBC says very matter-of-factly: 'Okay, now I want you to stick your finger up my ass.' And I'm like, 'What??...No!!' ""I was now scared. I wanted to get out of there, so I finally compromised: I slapped him on the ass and improvised a few lines as the character,"" added Wilson. Wilson additionally mentioned that she called her agent and spoke to a lawyer following the scene. ""I was encouraged to 'be professional and finish the film,'"" she wrote. She also claimed that she was asked to do reshoots, including for a sex scene, which made her feel uncomfortable on set. ""I filmed the scene, after demanding rewrites. But I still had to simulate having sex with this guy. I still had to kiss him repeatedly,"" noted Wilson. She then told producers she would not be doing any promotion for the film. Wilson additionally wrote, ""The movie bombed, which to me was karma enough. I'm not about canceling anybody and that's not my motivation for sharing this story. I'm sharing my story now because the more women talk about things like this, hopefully the less it happens."" Baron Cohen denied the actress' account of their time working together through a statement shared by his rep with The Hollywood Reporter earlier this week, shortly after her Instagram Story went up. It read, ""While we appreciate the importance of speaking out, these demonstrably false claims are directly contradicted by extensive detailed evidence, including contemporaneous documents, film footage and eyewitness accounts from those present before, during and after the production of The Brothers Grimsby."" His team also shared nine anonymous statements with People in support of Baron Cohen. Five of the people, who were identified as being involved in the film and witnessing the Cape Town scene, disputed Wilson's account. ""As per the script, which Rebel had read and approved in advance, her character was attempting to put a finger in Sacha's character's butt. At no point did Sacha actually ask her to put a finger in his butt,"" said a producer. A writer-producer added, ""This was a scheduled, scripted scene."" THR has reached out to reps for Baron Cohen for the statements. However, Wilson's sister Liberty and a friend (who remained anonymous) told the magazine that Wilson told them her experience shortly after filming the scene.  On March 23, Wilson had sharedin a deleted Instagram Story, ""I wrote about an asshole in my book. Now, said asshole is trying to threaten me. He's hired a crisis PR manager and lawyers. He is trying to stop press coming out about my book. But the book WILL come out, and you will all know the truth.""  A day later, she wrote another Instagram Story, exposing Baron Cohen: ""I will not be bullied or silenced by high priced lawyers or PR crisis managers. The 'asshole' that I am talking about in ONE CHAPTER of my book is: Sacha Baron Cohen.""

"March 27, 2024",Reddit's Most-Loved Tinted Lip Balm Is a $10 YSL Alternative That Leaves Lips Looking 'So Juicy',190,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission.Although I get paid to spend most of my day searching for the best deals and p roducts out there, I can't resist a good recommendation from my fellow beauty enthusiasts - whether that be through shopper reviews or just by talking to people I know. If you're looking to find beauty products actually worth getting, one you might want to search is Reddit.  Thanks to Redditors, you can find some really great recommendations on everything from the best foundation for mature skin to the best TikTok viral products. Since I'm in the market for a good tinted lip balm to give my lips some color and a much-needed moisture boost, I dug through some Reddit boards to find the best tinted lip balm that won't break the bank. As it turns out, there are so many good ones!  In a thread that originally posted a few months back, Redditors listed their picks for the best tinted lip balms that offer both staying power and good color payoff. Some highlights include Milani's $10 Color Fetish Lip Stain (it was a brand that was mentioned quite a few times, btw!), NYX's Butter Gloss, and CoverGirl's Clean Fresh Tinted Balm. But one shoutout that seemed to get a lot of praise was the K-beauty fave rom&nd Glasting Melting Balm.  REDDIT PICK rom&nd Glasting Melting Balm $10$1844% off Buy Now The product is described as a ""dewy and glassy"" lip balm that goes on smooth, offering a ""watery glow"" to your lips. It's non-greasy, moisturizing, and comes in seven shades, ranging from nude to a dark mauve. Per one Redditor, ""The color payoff is rich but natural, the formula is glossy but still leaves a slight stain, and the colors are incredible."" At a price range of $10 to $15, it's definitely worth checking out.  The Glasting Melting Balm has over 2,400 reviews, most of which are a perfect five-star rating. According to shoppers, there's kind of a lot to love about it. For instance, one reviewer said it's a good alternative to YSL's $42 balm writing, ""It's absolutely beautiful. I ordered the Hippie Berry. Amazingly, it stayed longer on my lips than I expected. It feels good on my lips and it's hydrating. I will be ordering other colors.""  Another said it made their lips look fuller. ""I bought it in the Lovey Pink shade and it is the cutest pink I've personally tried. Now, I have some sad, deflated tire-looking lips, but with a little bit of over lining and this lip balm, I sorta look like I got a bit of lip filler. Even though it's a balm, the color payoff is amazing. If all colors are this good and the formula is the same on all of it, I'll be buying the whole line. If you're thinking about buying it, just put it in your cart already. Do it."" One reviewer echoed their comment saying it's ""Immediately hydrating and vivid, it makes my lips look SO juicy.""  One reviewer loved it so much, they said it was ""hands down"" their favorite gloss balm. ""The formula is really thick and moisturizing, and the color payoff is really good. The best way to apply is to rub it really fast onto the lips, so that the friction melts the balm ... The gloss is glossy, the color is great, and it can last like 1 to 2 hours."" They did mention that it can get patchy at times, but it's still a great balm nonetheless.  Finally, numerous shoppers couldn't get enough of how moisturizing it is. ""This lip balm is one of the best,"" wrote one reviewer. ""Not only is it pigmented, but it's so, so, sooo smooth. It literally glides on like butter, and it's moisturizing too! Honestly one of my fave lippies from all the Korean lip products that I have. If you're debating on getting this, do it. It's definitely worth it.""

"January 21, 2024","Reese Witherspoon Responds to Fans Concerned She's Eating Snow: ""You Only Live Once""",191,"  Reese Witherspoon is going to have fun in the snow this winter, no matter what fans have to say. The Morning Show actress-producer took to TikTok on Friday to share a video of her making what she called a ""snow salt Chococinno."" In the footage, she scoops up snow into a coffee mug from what appeared to have accumulated on a car and then adds salted caramel syrup, chocolate syrup and cold brew on top. ""OK, so we've had a ton of snow over the past few days. We decided to make a recipe,"" she said in a voiceover. ""Oh my gosh, it's so good!"" @reesewitherspoon Snow days were made for Chococinnos ?? Let's go - Official Sound Studio But after she posted the video, some fans quickly took to her comment section to express concern about whether snow is safe to eat. One person wrote, ""No no no.. snow is not made to ear.. u can get seriously sick,"" while someone else said, ""Fallen snow can be very dirty from the air and wind but who cares. You only live once. I remember eating snow as a kid."" And well, Witherspoon is deciding to live by the motto: ""You only live once."" In a follow-up video, the Your Place or Mine actress said, ""OK, so we're kind of in a category of 'You only live once' and it snows maybe once a year here. I don't know! Also, I want to say something: It was delicious. It was so good (Laughs)."" On Saturday, she continued to defend her frosty treat, adding in another clip, ""OK, talking about the snow not being filtered, I didn't grow up drinking filtered water. We drank out of the tap water. We actually put our mouths on the tap and then sometimes like in the summer, when it was hot, we drank out of the hose, like, we put our mouth on the hose, growing up.""

"March 21, 2024",Ryan Phillippe Defends His Kids' Career Choices By Slamming the 'Offensive' Nepo Baby Debate,192,"  Ryan Phillippe thinks the nepo baby debate is a double standard, and he's not afraid to say so. The actor sat down with Extra TV to chat about his upcoming movie, Prey, and he shared some updates and praise for his eldest kids and their career endeavors. While proudly relaying his daughter Ava and son Deacon's professional accomplishments, Phillippe also made it clear that he ""gets offended"" for celebrity kids like his own who are labeled nepo babies. The Cruel Intentions alum shared that Ava is in an exploratory phase when it comes to her career interests, but that she's definitely drawn to acting. ""She's sort of getting her feet wet,"" Phillippe said. ""She's taking time to kind of figure out exactly what it is she wants to do.""

Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic. While on the subject of his and Reese Witherspoon's kids following in their footsteps, Phillippe admitted, ""That's what annoys me about this whole nepotism talk with the industry. You know, so many people grow up and end up doing what their parents do, to some degree or another."" The actor explained, ""I come from a really blue-collar family and so many of my family members, my cousins whose dad was an electrician, guess what they became - you know?"" Phillippe elaborated on his opinion, ultimately labeling it a double standard - and while nepotism is nuanced, he also isn't wrong. ""To me, I always get offended for the children of actors and entertainers when people bring that up because yeah, of course - that's what they've grown up around,"" he said. ""These kids have grown up watching on set with Reese or with me - it seems natural [that they would be interested in entertainment careers], I think,"" he concluded with a laugh. Ryan Phillippe & Reese Witherspoon at the ""Pleasantville"" premiere. Photo by Barry King/WireImage. This isn't the first time the Phillippe family has been involved in the nepotism debate. In November 2023, Deacon was publically branded a nepo baby after his New York City apartment tour with TikTok star Caleb Simpson went viral. Despite having roommates and speaking humbly, much of the public remained critical of the circumstances that led to Deacon being able to afford a spacious NYC loft. Deacon Phillippe, son of Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe, faced criticism after sharing his living space on TikTok. https://t.co/vhbluY87dQ - SheKnows (@SheKnows) November 15, 2023 During his interview, Phillippe also revealed just how deeply he's bonded with his son, explaining that they're ""particularly close"" out of his three kids ""because we have so much in common."" The I Know What You Did Last Summer star gushed, ""He makes me proud every single day of his life just in regard to the young man he's become to how he operates within the world. He's just such a source of light and love, and he's very solid and spiritual. He's got an incredible work ethic."" Of Deacon's musical and acting pursuits, Phillippe shared, ""He's really evolving as a musician. He's put out a lot of really good stuff at a young age and I'm excited to see what the future holds for him. I just feel the world is lucky to have him.""

""He may be joining me on this series and playing my character's brother in the flashbacks, so I'm kind of excited about that possibly happening,"" Phillippe told the outlet.

"March 15, 2024","Ryan Serhant Says ""Shouting It From the Mountains"" Is Key to Success in Any Business",193,"  There are people who stay on message - and then there's Ryan Serhant. The celebrity real estate broker, who gained global fame for his appearances on Million Dollar Listing New York, is hyper-focused, direct and as polished as the gleaming surfaces of the mega-penthouses he sells in Manhattan. Not a bad look when you've just published your third book, a guide to branding oneself and one's company. Titled Brand It Like Serhant: Stand Out From The Crowd, Build Your Following, and Earn More Money ($30, Hachette Go), the book takes readers through chapters designed as a step-by-step program that includes identifying a core identity, advice on using social media, and exhortations to ""shout it from the mountaintop,"" i.e. confidently and emphatically promote oneself. It includes exercises at the end of each chapter and even includes photos of Serhant modeling outfits and showing poses that do and don't work on social media platforms and in branded content. The book is based on Serhant's success as a mega-selling real estate agent who founded his own eponymous brokerage in 2020. In the new book, he also shares advice from others, interviewing a slew of top entrepreneurs and experts, including fashion designers Rebecca Minkoff and Kenneth Cole, Resy co-founder Gary Vaynerchuk, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck author Mark Manson, and interior designer Athena Calderone. Today, Serhant's brokerage operates in eight states, has just over 500 agents and did nearly $3 billion in residential real estate sales in 2023. The company - which recently hired its first president, Josh Team (former president of Keller Williams) - also touts that it is the most followed real estate brand in the world, lassoing around six million followers across social media platforms (including Serhant's ""Listed"" Youtube channel). He also runs an education platform called Sell It Like Serhant, which has 20,000 members from more than 110 countries, a significant percentage of whom aren't even real estate agents. Serhant - whose current listings include a $195 million three-floor NYC residence in the tallest residential tower in the world - speaks with THR about his new book Brand It Like Serhant, his plans to star in a new TV show (""maybe it comes out soon""), whether he plans to expand Serhant to the West Coast, and his advice on how to tap into one's core identity and promote it for business success. What was the genesis of you becoming a book author? So I spent from 2008 to 2017 basically writing as I was going about my life as a salesperson [and] everything that I was learning because I knew I would forget it. So how to work with buyers, how to work with sellers, how to build a personal brand, how to be confident in the moment, all of that. A good part of that turned into what my first book was, which was Sell It Like Serhant in 2018. That then became an online education business that then became a speaking tour that then became a TV show on Bravo called Sell It Like Serhant. And it's all the sales tools you need to learn how to sell anything to anyone. And then I followed that up during COVID in 2021 with Big Money Energy, which was okay, now you have the sales tools, but if your palms are sweaty, if you don't have the confidence, then it's just going to be a toolbox that sits in your closet. Interior of the Central Park Tower Penthouse, listed with Serhant for $195 million. And now you have your third book. The final piece of what I've called my selling trilogy is then, ""Great, you know how to sell. You have the confidence to sell, but if no one knows what you're selling, it's all moot."" And I looked hard for a brand manual, like a branding blueprint for today, and everything I found was old. It is dated now. Everything needs to be updated. So I want a book that teaches me how to use Threads, Twitter X, TikTok, and thought leadership across LinkedIn. Effectively, I want a book that teaches me a brand strategy system. So if I am just starting out in real estate or in fitness or in retail or apparel or I'm a writer, I'm going to build my own personal brand. This is my longest and biggest book ever. It goes through everything I know on how to build personal and product brands in today's world and beyond. And what I did differently in this one compared to the first two was I'm not the only person that has worked on building a brand before or thinks about it all the time. So let me go and interview a lot of different people and just get their thoughts across the board. So I want to talk to YouTube influencers, social media stars. I want Gary Vaynerchuk in there. I want Mark Manson who's one of the biggest authors of all time. I want Kenneth Cole who everyone knows what a Kenneth Cole shoe is, but how does he think about brand and the social impact of brand? I want to talk to this amazing woman who is rebranding periods and creating period power with her brand of tampons and pads and not making it like something that has to be a secret and hush hush the way marketing always was, but actually bring power to something that half the world experiences every month. All that's in there. When you started your education platform Sell It Like Serhant, it was obviously geared toward teaching real estate agents how to sell better. How broad has it become now? We have surgery centers in Asia, we have supply chain managers. We have fundraisers for hedge funds. [We have] boat jet and real estate brokers, obviously. Just all these different industries that have come to us and every time they come we're like, ""Why are you here? Do you know what I do?"" They're like, ""yeah, well sorry, but where else do I go? I need to learn how to sell more and build a bigger brand so I can generate more business."" So we help people get there. You don't have to be super beautiful and bubbly and know how to dance with a hula hoop on TikTok to build a brand. Serhant's listings include this 8,000-square-foot home in East Hampton, New York, with six bedroom suites, a pool and an outdoor living pavilion. It's listed with Serhant's Kieran Brew for $17.95 million. Let's talk more about some of the tips you share. What about the third part of your book called ""Shout It From the Mountaintop""? Success begets success. We have a thing that we call the Serhant brand strategy system. Once you have your core identity, then you create consistent content, whatever that means for you. Then again, no one's going to know what you sell if you don't tell them. So what is your way that's authentic to you to shout it from the mountain top to amplify your success? And I think a lot of people get confused that that's bragging, and they don't feel comfortable doing that. But you're not bragging. You're congratulating [for example] your client on another great article, on a great job building an amazing home that's sold in record time. You're not saying hats off to me for doing it again. What are ways that you recommend someone figure out what their core identity is? Write an essay about it. Do the work because that then is your lookalike target audience that you're going to go after because so many people try to just put themselves out there as a brand or their product is a brand and they try to be everything to everyone, which in turn makes you nothing to no one. So go after that niche and let that niche carry you where you want to go. So once you know that core identity, then you go out into the world, you're on social media, you're at a party, you're everywhere. That core identity leaves your lips or leaves your fingertips, and that becomes the perception that the world has of you, has of your brand, of your product. And then what happens? Then you leave the room, you put your phone down, you leave the networking event or wherever you were. Now people talk about you behind your back. So now that perception becomes reputation. Over time, that reputation becomes your brand and what you're known for. Ryan Serhant appeared on Bravo's What What Happens Live with Andy Cohen in February.  You've said that Serhant is a media company that happens to sell real estate. What do you mean by that? I mean, what is a traditional real estate brokerage anyway, right? It's a real estate advertising company that holds licenses legally for other human beings to advertise real estate and then help people transact. I believe strongly when we started this that our core differentiator is that we have an in-house production company and we are a media company that sells real estate and sells it really, really well with the best of the best in the industry. And so if you're a seller, you're going to pay a commission. You want to get the most bang for your buck, I think at least I hope you do. So you might as well go to the firm that has the largest real estate brokerage following on the planet with the people that are the experts in your asset. And if you're a buyer, you want to go with the people who have the most access. People reach out directly because you have that platform of awareness creation. And so I think that's what we're building and there's fun technology that makes that actually happen and there's a big team around it. So we're not like Hollywood Reporter for real estate. We're a new type of company and it's growing quickly and we're figuring it out a little bit every day. Are your agents using AI to write listings and help with other marketing? Serhant's listings include this new-construction, single-family townhome on Minetta Street in Manhattan that includes a garage, rooftop with outdoor kitchen and hot tub, and a garden with a waterfall and bamboo. It's listed with Serhant's Andy Klaric and Chase Landow for $18.5 million. We use a significant amount of AI now. We put out our first product, [an AI tool] called S.MPLE. Do you have any plans for the West Coast? Yeah, eventually. Right now I like to be emergency flying distance. We're opening up Georgia and then I'll jump into South Carolina where we have great presence already. I can fly in the morning and can be back that night. Can't do that in L.A. or in San Francisco, and it's a different market. I look at publicly traded companies and see what their performance has been like in the West Coast after coming from the East Coast, and there's a lot to learn about what not to do, and I just want to look at the mistakes and the wins of the people who have built great businesses before me and take the best, leave the rest. What can you say about reports that you're planning a new TV series, working title House of Serhant, with Netflix? So Million Dollar Listing ended when I started the company in 2020. But I had a conversation with Bravo when I started the company and they said, ""We're happy to follow your evolution. We've been doing that for 10 years with you. We met you when you were 24 and going on dates in the Financial District and now things are different. That said viewers follow format and imagine watching Law and Order and one of the detectives goes off and starts their own detective agency. That would be a different show."" So I said, ""Fair, no problem. We all evolve."" And so that show came to an end after a decade and I might be working on something new that I can't talk about, but if I did, it would be awesome and it would be an evolution of the genre in a way that's pretty crazy and maybe it comes out soon. What do you predict the real estate market will be like this year? I think we'll probably see a slowdown probably in the fall just as people are really just going to want to see what happens with the [presidential] election. Inventory is still historically low. The country is short just over three million houses. It's crazy. In good standard years, we're seeing north of six million homes trade in the United States every year.

"March 14, 2024","Scooter Braun Launches Campaign to Help Palestinians in Gaza and Israeli Hostage Families: ""You Can Do Two Things""",194,"  Scooter Braun is stepping up his efforts to help the people affected by the Oct. 7th terrorist attacks in Israel and Palestinians suffering from the devastating war in Gaza, with the music mogul keen to stress ""you can do two things,"" by helping both groups.  The HYBE-America CEO posted a lengthy video on Instagram on Wednesday night that outlined his plans to work with humanitarian agency CARE International and the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel, personally donating a total of $200,000 to get much-needed financial support to the people most acutely impacted by the ongoing conflict.  Braun said he, along with his Palestinian-American friend Nasim and Scott Budnik, will be kicking off the Care Together campaign with Care.org next week and that he would be personally donating $100,000. The campaign, Braun says, ""will help 200 Palestinian families with sustainable help in this time of need.""  He also stated that at the same time he will donate $100,000 to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel, a group that according to its website says it ""offers families holistic medical and emotional support as well as professional assistance, and advances the ongoing efforts locally, regionally and globally, to bring the hostages and the missing back home.""  Braun added, ""I've always said something, you can do two things. You can say, free the hostages, and also want the Palestinian people who are innocent to be protected from Hamas and this war."" In the video, Braun began by speaking about his late grandmother Eva, a Holocaust survivor, on the occasion of what would have been her 94th birthday, and how her kindness inspires him to ""do what I do next.""  ""The world is a crazy place, and I feel like there's a very big misunderstanding. There's all this antisemitism, hate, finger-pointing in all directions. But it's not because I would refute my Judaism, or it's not because I'm not proud of my Judaism that I do what I do next,"" Braun says, seeming to reference the online criticism he has received recently from some sections of the BTS fandom and also perhaps a passing reference to Jonathan Glazer's Oscar's speech with the use of the word ""refute.""  He adds that he is doing what he is doing ""because of my grandmother, because of my grandfather, because of what they endured, because of the lessons that they taught me, and the lessons that my Judaism teaches me that I care.""  Full text of Braun's video message. I normally don't make videos for these type of things, but I felt like this was important. Today would have been the 94th birthday of my grandmother, Ma, Eva. She was a Holocaust survivor, a survivor of the Auschwitz concentration camp. In her honor, I do what I do next. The world is a crazy place, and I feel like there's a very big misunderstanding. There's all this anti-Semitism hate, finger-pointing in all directions. But it's not because I would refute my Judaism, or it's not because I'm not proud of my Judaism that I do what I do next. It's because of my grandmother, because of my grandfather, because of what they endured, because of the lessons that they taught me, and the lessons that my Judaism teaches me that I care. Because of that, with the help of my friend Nasim, a Palestinian-American who's also the son of a refugee just like me, and my friend Scott Budnik, we're starting a campaign next week called Care Together, along with the organization Care.org, which will get aid to Palestinians, innocent Palestinians in need right now. I will personally be donating $100,000 to kick off that campaign, and that will help 200 Palestinian families with sustainable help in this time of need. But I've always said something, you can do two things. You can say, free the hostages, and also want the Palestinian people who are innocent to be protected from Hamas and this war. That is why I'll also be matching that $100,000 with another $100,000 donation to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum in Israel to help those families affected by Oct. 7th, and those families still suffering because those hostages deserve and must come home. I wanted to do this because you can do two things. You can call for the hostages, and you can call for innocent people in a war to be protected. I want to be clear that it is because of my culture, because of my Judaism, because of the idea of 'tikun olam,' which means repair the world, heal the world, which is all Jews are called on to do, that I make these donations, and I ask people to do the same, and I ask people to step up with action. In honor of my grandmother, in honor of her 94th birthday. She saw the absolute worst of humanity. She wasn't yelling at people on TikTok or Instagram. She lived it. She was 15 years old when they ripped her from her home, and 26 members of her family, including her parents and her sister, were killed. She stayed in that concentration camp for a year until she was liberated, [she was there] every single day. Even though [my grandmother] saw the worst of humanity, she chose to be kind to all people. That is why, in this moment, while I believe Israel has the right to defend itself and Israelis have the right to protection and safety, I think the same for Palestinians. It is because I am a Jew that I make these donations. I'm grateful to my Palestinian-American friend... Both of us grew up in Connecticut. Both of us love Thundercats. Both of us love our families. If my family would have immigrated to Israel and his family would have stayed in the West Bank, we might be put in a position to fight right now with each other. But because we're here, we have an opportunity to be friends and try and go towards a future that we all claim we want over there. I know this was long-winded, but Ma, this one was for you. I love you. I miss you. I hope everyone can join in and do the same. Thanks.

"March 10, 2024","SCRATCHINGS THAT ITCH AT A HEAD SPA; Inside luxe scalp treatment craze that touts close analysis, deep clean",195,"  I've never given much thought to my scalp. Aside from the occasional subconscious scritch-scratch or vigorous shampooing, it's kind of just ... there. A necessary but often-overlooked cranium cover. But the humble scalp is the focus of an increasingly popular wellness trend: elaborate Chinese and Japanese-inspired treatments at so-called head spas. At these businesses, visitors receive a scalp analysis followed by head and neck massages and repeated deep cleanses. Ogling the inner workings of the scalp, an otherwise forgotten body part -- and addressing its needs through blissful hydrotherapy treatments -- has driven the hashtag #headspa to draw attention on TikTok for more than a year now. In one viral video of an L.A.-area head spa, a towel-clad influencer claims it will ""change your life."" I was intrigued. Which is how I came to find myself sitting in a salon chair at Cai Xiang Ge, or ""CXG,"" in San Gabriel, with a practitioner weaving a tiny digital camera through my hair. I faced a 250-times-magnified view of my scalp on a nearby screen. And what I saw resembled an eerie underwater kelp forest, with dark, swaying stalks growing out of a glistening, spongy field dotted with red patches. It looked like something out of a sci-fi film. Ew. The process was embarrassingly revealing. Turns out I have an oily scalp with bits of dandruff, CXG owner Ning Chen told me. ""And see these red parts? You're not getting enough sleep. Stress,"" she said. But there's also a strange delight in examining your dirty scalp up close. As humans, we are nothing if not fascinated by our own bodies, whether that's picking a scab, prodding a canker sore or popping a pimple. (You know you've done it.) The shock factor of scalp treatments is integral to its appeal, according to Sara Hallajian, a Santa Monica-based trichologist and hair loss and scalp specialist at Ame Salon. ""It's about: 'Oh, let's look at your dandruff up close, and how dirty your scalp is before and how clean after,' because it's not something you see with the naked eye,"" Hallajian said. After my scalp's close-up, Chen led me into a dimly lighted room with multiple spa beds and traditional Chinese harp music. Birds chirped on the soundtrack as I changed into a robe and reclined on the bed. On one end was a shampoo basin, at the other a foot bath, filled with warm water steeped with Chinese herbs. It was early February, and I generally appreciate rituals around renewal this time of year, cliched as it may seem. The $135 Royal Treatment scratched that itch. For 90 minutes, CXG's Alyssa Nevins repeatedly scrubbed my scalp and washed my hair as part of a six-step process. The aromatherapy head massage was a dry one, in which Nevins rubbed tingly-feeling tea tree oil into my scalp and then applied an electronic, cephalopod-like device, its multiple arms whirling away tension. That was followed by four shampooings, each with a head and neck massage. The highlight: Nevins left me lying there for 10 minutes with a circular, waterfall-like device bathing my head and neck in herb-treated water. I wore a heated eye mask, my head was tilted backward and my face was immersed in plumes of steam. Thin jets of water massaged my neck and shoulders. It was heavenly; I nearly fell asleep. I also got a hydrating, collagen-boosting facial, an herbal hair steam and a conditioning hair masque. The experience ended in the salon, with tea and sweets and an ""anti-hair loss treatment."" Nevins sprayed an herbal serum all over my scalp. She then used a high-frequency scalp therapy device to disinfect my pores, a treatment the spa said would fortify hair follicles. Head spas claim that scalp treatments promote circulation and detoxify, calm and hydrate skin, all of which help prevent dandruff, itchiness, dryness, inflammation and hair loss. I wasn't sure whether that was true or not, but it sure beats injecting my own plasma into my scalp at $1,500 per session, another recently en vogue beauty treatment aimed at promoting hair growth. The claims that head spas make are ""fundamentally correct,"" said Dr. Carolyn Goh, a dermatologist at UCLA Health. ""A deep clean and massage can help with circulation and reduce inflammation. My first recommendation to anyone suffering from hair loss is to make your scalp clean. But if you have psoriasis or eczema, it's not going to help. I'd also caution if you're sensitive and using essential oils -- you can develop an allergy."" The treatment stimulates acupressure points in the head, particularly one called bai hui, where the so-called meridians meet, according to Dr. Ka-Kit Hui, director of the UCLA Health Center for East-West Medicine. ""That may help people with insomnia, anxiety, headaches. It's costly, but it's relaxing."" Scalp treatments have been an integral part of wellness culture for centuries in many parts of Asia, including in China, Japan, Vietnam and Korea. In China, head spas are so common that ""there's one on every street,"" Chen said. They caught on here in L.A. around 2020 and have proliferated in the last year and a half. Now, Chen says, there are about two dozen in the L.A. area, with ""about four new ones opening nearby in the past two months alone."" Most of them are in San Gabriel, Temple City, Arcadia and Rosemead -- hubs for Asian communities In addition to CXG, other popular local head spas include Yang Si Guan in San Gabriel, Tou Dao Tang in Temple City and M Head Spa in Rosemead, all of which have opened within the last year and a half. Chen said her head spa helped kick off the trend in L.A. when CXG opened in mid-2021. She plans to expand CXG into Beverly Hills within the next year. Like many head spas, CXG serves one-timers as well as members who visit weekly or biweekly to relax and maintain scalp health. Chen's clientele was initially 70% Asian and 30% non-Asian; by summer 2023, it was the opposite, which she said is due to social media promotion. Videos of Chinese scalp treatments on social media are popular among seekers of ASMR -- autonomous sensory meridian response -- in which certain sounds promote tingling, goosebumps and other relaxing sensations. In person, the ASMR experience is even more pronounced. Throughout the treatment, there are the sounds of repeated brush swooshes, shampoo lathering and sloshing water. This was especially evident at Tou Dao Tang when I visited. Tou Dao Tang originated in China, where it has more than 9,000 locations. But in fall 2022, the company launched its first U.S. outlet in Temple City. It has plans to expand into Glendale later this year. Openings also are in the works for Tustin, Las Vegas, San Francisco and New York. ""It's the new thing,"" manager Hannah Lin says of scalp treatment's growing popularity. ""And people want to try the new thing."" My scalp analysis, conducted by Tou Dao Tang's Sherry Zhu, again reported oily skin, dandruff and sleep deprivation as well as a possible nutrition deficiency, Zhu said. The latter was suggested by a few pale-colored hairs. The subsequent $108 Classic Scalp treatment was a five-step process. It was especially massage-oriented, with repeated scalp kneading, hair combing and cleansing over 90 minutes, and involved five teas, or ""herbal soups,"" each infused with different organic herbs. The rounds of tea-washing focused, respectively, on detoxification, rejuvenation and stress relief, nourishment and calming, repairing pH balance and hair loss prevention. These treatments have become so essential for some patrons of Tou Dao Tang that members often keep their own combs and brushes at the spa, labeled with their names, for practitioners to use when they visit. ""In China, the head spa is so popular,"" Lin said. ""We wanted to bring it to the U.S. and let people know about our culture."" The head spas I visited were very different experiences. CXG's environs were especially luxurious, complete with multicolored lights, aromatherapy and a warm foot bath, while Tou Dao Tang's home-brewed, organic ""tea bath"" washings felt more down-to-earth. They both left me feeling squeaky clean and relaxed -- so much so that at Tou Dao Tang, I accidentally floated out the door without paying. (I called back later and took care of the bill.) After both treatments, my hair was shiny and extra-soft for days. Needless to say, the itch I had for a feeling of renewal was sufficiently scratched.

"January 29, 2024",Serena Williams' Daughter Olympia Ruined Her Latest TikTok Thanks to Snack Time,196,"  Snack time is sacred. It's that important time between meals where you get to eat something sweet or savory to hold you over until your next meal. Without it, you risk getting cranky, irritable, or downright hangry - and Serena Williams' 6-year-old daughter Olympia knows it is not to be missed. No matter what else is happening at the moment! In this case, Olympia interrupted a TikTok to munch on something, and the whole thing is so funny.

(Photo by Dan Istitene - Formula 1/Formula 1 via Getty Images) ""I take olympia to the car wash for fun. Gotta teach her the oldies :)"" the 23-time Grand Slam champion captioned the TikTok. It started as a sweet mother-daughter moment, with Williams in the front seat filming herself and Olympia in the back. Williams sings ""at the car wash!"" from the 1976 song ""Car Wash"" by R&B band Rose Royce. Then, she turns the camera to Olympia, who croons, ""whoa, whoa, whoa!"" Williams repeats her line, periodically turning the camera to Olympia to catch her part. It is utterly adorable and moving along perfectly ... until it was time for a snack. When it was time for Olympia to sing her part, she completely missed her cue because she was eating something and gazing out the window. Singing with mom is great, but not when it interrupts the most important time of the day! @serena I take olympia to the car wash for fun.

"February 23, 2024",Sharna Burgess' Son Zane Has a Funny Beach Day Mishap & Fans Are Losing It Over the Cute Video,197,"  Beach days aren't quite the same when you have a toddler in tow. Sure, you get sun and sand and beautiful views, but it's much less relaxing than your pre-child days were. You have to be on constant guard - before you even get to the beach! Sharna Burgess shared a funny example of this recently, when her 20-month-old son Zane had a mishap on a recent beach day. If you've ever had a toddler, you will definitely be able to relate. Beach Day LOS ANGELES, CA - MARCH 30: Brian Austin Green and Sharna Burgess are seen on March 30, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Hollywood To You/Star Max/GC Images) The Dancing with the Stars pro shared a video of herself getting ready to go to the beach with her baby, who she shares with fiancé Brian Austin Green. In the video, she's folding clothes, making peanut butter and banana wraps, and waking up her baby boy, who looks adorable with his long blonde hair and sweet smile. She gets him dressed and cheers when he eats a bite of the snack she made (which she drizzled with honey, yum!), but then the unexpected happens. He founds a stick of face sunscreen and eats it! She films the aftermath, with Zane holding the stick in one hand and looking up at his mom guiltily, with the sunscreen al over his lips and cheeks. Ugh, kids! Later, Zane swims in the ocean, plays in the sand, and goes down a slide at a playground. It looks like such a fun day, despite the sunscreen lunch!

Another commented, ""he's just so adorable! and what a lovely mummy you are ??."" View this post on Instagram A post shared by ??????????????

""Also today I actually used banana for breakfast and I though I crushed it but turns out I was mistaken ... and we went back to banana ,"" she wrote. She's referring to a meltdown that happened earlier this month when she didn't give her toddler a banana. ""How often do you make breakfast for your little only to find out you've made a grave error and all they wanted was a banana.... "" she captioned a video on Instagram. ""How dare you not know this #toddlerlife #terribletwos came early Also I ruined his day by putting clothes on him.. so there's that (Those of you that vote never.. we cannot be friends ).""

"March 25, 2024",Start of the true crime craze; Fox Nation takes on Menendez brothers trial that blazed a trail for the genre.,210,"  If there were a Mount Rushmore of true crime, the faces of Erik and Lyle Menendez would certainly be on it. The 1989 murder case of the two brothers who gunned down their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills mansion predates the era of podcasting and YouTube sleuths that saturate the internet today. But their sensational trials were inescapable in the 1990s and now resonate with a new generation of obsessives. The public's enduring fascination with the case -- and the changing perceptions of the brothers' defense that they were sexually abused by their father -- is the focus of ""Menendez Brothers: Victims or Villains,"" a new documentary series that premieres Monday on Fox News Media's streaming service Fox Nation. ""It's the first such case in American media history that was something more than a legal story,"" Jonathan Towers, vice president of development for Fox Nation, said in an interview. ""It was a form of entertainment."" The case's powerful mixture of family dysfunction, money and violence has made it the subject of two made-for-TV movies, an upcoming Netflix series from Hollywood producer Ryan Murphy and a steady stream of documentaries over the years. It's easy to understand audiences' insatiable appetite for stories about the brothers. Entering the living room of the family's Elm Drive home on Aug. 20, 1989, the brothers fired 12-gauge shotguns multiple times at their parents, creating a crime scene so blood-soaked even Sam Peckinpah would have looked away. After telling police that their parents were murdered, the brothers went on a conspicuous spending spree before they were arrested for the crime. At their trial, defense teams said they were driven to kill after years of being physically and sexually abused by their father. Their first trial in 1993 ended in hung juries. They were re-tried and convicted in 1996 and are serving prison sentences of life without parole at the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego. The first Menendez trial took place when cameras in the courtroom were still novel and cable TV was growing. Courtroom video became programming for Court TV, one of the early signature networks of the then expanding multi-channel universe. Instead of sketches or print and TV journalism accounts, viewers watched the criminal justice system play out in real time. The shared experience of observing the proceedings made the Menendez brothers ubiquitous. Every facial expression was scrutinized, as ""Victims or Villains,"" produced by the Los Angeles-based Pilgrim Media Group, depicts with dozens of vintage video clips. Los Angeles commuters heard KFI radio hosts John Kobylt and Ken Chiampou riff on the topic daily. Network news and tabloid shows such as ""A Current Affair"" featured the story every night. Loftier venues such as Charlie Rose's PBS talk show and ABC's ""Nightline"" with Ted Koppel weighed in as well. The Menendez brothers paved the way for the live-from-L.A. legal saga of O.J. Simpson that began in 1994. The televised trial of the actor and former football star for the killing of his wife Nicole Brown Smith and her friend Ron Goldman was such a ratings draw it dealt a blow to network daytime soap operas from which they would never recover. True crime sagas and court cases went on to become the main source material for network newsmagazines such as ""Dateline"" and ""48 Hours."" They have proliferated on dedicated cable networks such as Investigation Discovery, supplied streaming platforms, and serve as a massive driver for podcasts such as Ashley Flowers' ""Crime Junkie."" Murdoch family-controlled Fox News Media has turned to true crime to build its Fox Nation streaming business. The platform, which has 2 million paid subscribers, is stocking up on investigative documentaries that can attract a younger audience than that of the company's conservative-leaning cable news channel. But what may be the most jarring aspect of ""Victims or Villains"" is how the Menendez brothers were a source of laughs. They were depicted in sketches on ""Saturday Night Live"" and spoofed by Jay Leno on ""The Tonight Show."" (Both shows lampooned the Simpson trial as well as including Leno's dancing troupe of Judge Lance Ito lookalikes). ""It is fascinating to see how it was a matter of comedy back then,"" Towers said. ""It would not be today."" ""Victims or Villains"" examines how the media frenzy around the Menendez brothers permeated into the public perception of the case. Their defense was called ""the abuse excuse"" by some legal pundits and critics. ""Are we on the verge of substituting a talk show empathy for our criminal code?"" Koppel asked his ""Nightline"" viewers. The documentary also explores how the ridicule the juries and prosecutors were subjected to after the mistrial affected the second trial that ended with a conviction. Those latter proceedings were not televised. But the public understanding of the trauma sexual abuse can have on children, including among men, has evolved over the years. Various cases involving the molestation of children by members of the Catholic Church, the trial of Penn State coach Jerry Sandusky and actors speaking out about abuse have altered the once-taboo conversation. Comedian and actor Rosie O'Donnell, a victim of sexual abuse, appears in ""Victims or Villains"" as an advocate for the brothers and the validity of their claims. She has been joined by the droves of young social media users who have discovered the case. During the COVID-19 shutdowns, the current iteration of Court TV -- a digital over-the-air network owned by Scripps -- aired the Menendez trial in its entirety; it is also available via streaming. Captive viewers tuned in and many took to TikTok to express support for the siblings and their contention that abuse drove them to kill. The changing public sentiment comes as the current legal team for the Menendez brothers seeks a new hearing based on recently discovered evidence purporting to show their father had also molested Roy Rossello, when the singer was a 14-year-old member of the boy band Menudo. The Menendez lawyers contend the new evidence corroborates the brothers' claims and supports the argument that they should have been convicted of manslaughter instead of first-degree murder. The doubters remain. Pam Bozanich, a member of the Los Angeles County District Attorney's prosecution team for the first Mendendez trial, has sat for 14 documentary interviews over the years. In ""Victims or Villains,"" she still maintains the brothers fabricated the story of their father's abuse. ""The facts in this case are irrefutable,"" Bozanich said. ""Except for the ones about Jose being a child molester."" Graphic    PHOTO: ROSIE O'Donnell advocates for brothers in ""Victims or Villains.""

"March 14, 2024",Steve Mnuchin Says He Is Putting Together Group to Buy TikTok,211,"  Former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin says he wants to pull together a group of investors to buy TikTok. Mnuchin, who also has connections to Hollywood, announced his plans on CNBC Thursday morning.  The House of Representatives passed a bill this week that would force TikTok owner Bytedance to divest the video platform, and while the bill's future in the Senate is uncertain, potential buyers like Mnuchin are already beginning to pull together game plans, should it pass. ""I think the legislation should pass and I think it should be sold,"" Mnuchin said. ""It's a great business, and I'm going to put together a group to buy TikTok."" ""This should be owned by U.S. businesses. There's no way that the Chinese would ever let a U.S. company own something like this in China,"" he added. It is not clear what other companies, firms or people Mnuchin has spoken to, but TikTok would be an expensive acquisition, should the bill pass and ByteDance put it on the market. The video platform has quickly become one of the most popular apps in the U.S., with its short-form, music-laden videos sparking knockoffs from Meta (Reels) and Google (YouTube Shorts). If ByteDance sells, it is likely that other possible buyers would emerge. Walmart and Oracle were among the companies interested in TikTok when Trump was floating a similar TikTok divestiture plan. After leaving the Trump White House, Mnuchin launched his own firm called Liberty Strategic Capital, which raised some $2.5 billion to buy and invest in companies, including those developing ""new forms of content."" His firm also acquired a substantial stake in the independent film studio Lionsgate, spending around $50 million for 7.9 percent of the company. Mnuchin was a Goldman Sachs banker before becoming a Hollywood financier, backing films like The Lego Movie, Mad Max: Fury Road and a number of DC Comics titles at Warner Bros. Late last year he also welcomed a new baby with wife Louise Linton, who is releasing her own romantic comedy called Chick Flick.

"March 18, 2024","Studiocanal Partners With 'Mayhem!,' 'Perpetrator' Producer WTFilms on Genre Slate",212,"  Studiocanal is teaming up with French production outfit WTFilms on a slate of European genre films. The agreement will see Studiocanal and WTFilms collaborate in the development, production and distribution of action, thriller, science fiction and horror movie over a period of at least two years. Studiocanal will act as a co-producer and distributor for WTFilms projects selected during that time.The new collobration sprang from Studiocanal's successful partnership with WTFilms on Xavier Gens' action thriller Mayhem!, which was a fantasy festivals hit last year and was picked up by IFC Films for the U.S. ""The success of Mayhem! reinforced our choice to focus our production projects on genre, ranging from action to thriller and horror,"" said WTFilms co-founders Dimitri Stephanides and Gregory Chambet. ""Since its beginning, the DNA of WTFilms has been closely linked to our personal taste for this cinema. Today, we are very enthusiastic about the idea of plowing this furrow with Studiocanal, whose ambitions in this area align with ours and those of many talented directors, to produce films with strong commercial potential both in France and abroad.""The WTFilms deals follows Studiocanal's launch of its own, still-unnamed, genre label, which Paddington producer Jed Benedict is heading up. Benedict and Studiocanal's French production team will work with WTFilms under the scope of the new partnership.  Stephanides and Chambet launched WTFilms (What The Films) in 2012, initally as a sales company with a focus on international genre movies, handling world sales for such features as Carles Torrens' horror film Pet (2016) starring Dominic Monaghan, the Bill Pullman western The Ballad of Lefty Brown (2017), and Dominique Rocher's Parisian-set arthouse zombie movie The Night Eats The World. More recently, WTFilms has moved into production, backing Gens' Mayhem! and Jennifer Reeder's feminist horror film Perpetrator starring Alicia Silverstone. ""The WTFilms teams are experts in their field and enthusiasts of genre films, who will bring a lot to Studiocanal,"" said WTFilms' François Mergier, director of French production, and Assia Barge, head of French production, who negotiated the agreement. ""This partnership is so promising, and we hope to bring incredible genre projects to audiences worldwide in years to come!""

"February 26, 2024",Supreme Court hears 1st Amendment clash on whether Texas and Florida can regulate social media,213,"  The Supreme Court will consider Monday whether Florida and Texas can regulate social media to protect ""conservative speech,"" or instead whether Facebook, You Tube, TikTok and others have a free-speech right to decide what appears on their sites.  This 1st Amendment clash also features a dispute over how to characterize these popular and profitable sites. Are they private companies like a newspaper or a book store with full free-speech rights to decide what material to include or exclude?  Or as Justice Clarence Thomas has insisted, are these online platforms more properly described as ""common carriers"" like a telephone company with a legal duty to carry all speech and discriminate against none based on the message? The outcome will be closely watched in the blue states as well as the red ones.  Last year, the California Legislature adopted a measure to prohibit online companies from collecting and selling data on children and teenagers, but it was blocked on 1st Amendment grounds by a federal judge in San Jose. The state's appeal is now before the 9th Circuit Court.  The Biden administration is also facing suits from several Republican states for allegedly pressuring social media sites to remove ""disinformation"" on the dangers of COVID-19 vaccines. The Supreme Court will hear that case next month.  The Florida and Texas laws under review at the Supreme Court arose from the complaints that former President Trump was being discriminated against or blocked by social media sites, including Twitter.  In 2021, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed into law his state's first-in-the-nation law and said it targeted the ""Big Tech censors"" who ""discriminate in favor of the dominant Silicon Valley ideology.""  The measure, adopted before billionaire Elon Musk purchased Twitter and changed its name to X, applies to social media sites with more than $100 million in annual revenue or more than 100 million users.  It authorizes suits for damages for ""unfair censorship"" and large fines if a social media site ""deplatforms"" a candidate for office, as happened for a time to Trump after he continued to spread false claims about the 2020 election. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said ""conservative speech"" was threatened when he signed a somewhat broader bill a few months later. It says a social media platform with more than 50 million users in the United States ""may not censor ... or otherwise discriminate against expression"" of users based on their viewpoint.  NetChoice and the Computer & Communications Industry Assn. sued to challenge both laws on free-speech grounds, and both were put on hold, including by a 5-4 order from the Supreme Court.  The two federal appeals courts in the South, speaking through Trump appointees, took opposite stands on the free-speech issue. Judge Kevin Newsom, speaking for the 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta, blocked most of Florida's law from taking effect on the grounds it was unconstitutional.  The 1st Amendment ""constrains government actors and protects private actors,"" he said. Social media sites are private companies, and ""put simply, with minor exceptions, the government can't tell a private person or entity what to say or how to say it."" Judge Andrew Oldham, speaking for the 5th Circuit Court in New Orleans, upheld the Texas law on the grounds the state sought to protect the free speech rights of Texans. A former counsel to Abbott and a law clerk to Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr., Oldham said it is a ""rather odd inversion of the 1st Amendment"" to say the social media platforms have a ""right to muzzle speech. ... We reject the idea that corporations have a freewheeling 1st Amendment right to censor what people say."" Both state measures also require social media sites to disclose how they decide on removing information or users. That part of the Florida law was not blocked by the lower courts.

And oh, by the way, if you don't think she understands a thing or two about revenge, just take a listen to ""Reputation"" or ask Scooter Braun or David Mueller. Taylor commands a social media army: 280 million followers on Instagram, 95.1 million on X, 23.9 million on TikTok, 80 million on Facebook and 56.3 million on YouTube. By comparison, Donald Trump has 23.7 million followers on the 'gram, 87.4 million on X, 24.5 million on Facebook, and 2.8 million on YouTube. The numbers speak for themselves. And there's more. A survey conducted last year by the Morning Consult found that avid Swift fans skew suburban, Democratic and, not surprisingly, female. They're mostly 18 to 39 years old. In the post-Dobbs political landscape, these are among the demographics President Biden most needs to turn out in order to pull off a November win. So while the obvious response to the MAGA hysteria might be to endorse Biden -- something the president's team is hoping will happen -- it's not Swift's best move. She endorsed Biden in 2020. Another endorsement isn't going to move the needle. Instead, the single most effective thing Taylor Swift could do to influence the presidential election is use her celebrity, exposure and platforms to get her army of Swifties registered to vote. A recent poll conducted by the Harvard Institute of Politics revealed that after record turnout in the 2020 elections, only half of 18-to-29-year-olds who voted then are planning to participate in the 2024 election. A poll conducted by NBC News showed young voters souring on Biden. A USA Today/Suffolk University poll had Biden losing the youth vote to Trump. If this election is going to be as close as the polls and prognosticators would have us believe, activating Swift's army of fans could be a difference maker. Without openly endorsing a candidate, she could launch her own voter registration effort and send the right-wing MAGA-sphere into meltdown mode. Imagine if Swift announced even a handful of relatively modest acoustic concerts in the swing states (Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin) where the price of admission was proof that you were registered to vote. Voter registration booths would be set up in front of the venue. The only problem would be dealing with the crowds. In September, Swift's voter registration superpower went on display. In an Instagram post, she pointed her followers toward the nonpartisan, nonprofit Vote.org website, which reported a 35,000 new-registration surge. In the run-up to the 2018 midterms, a post urging her followers to register to vote was linked to 100,000 new voter registrations in the 18-to-29 demographic. If this is the kind of engagement she generated from single posts, imagine the impact of a swing-state tour in support of voter registration. Trump's MAGA army has made a critical mistake waging open warfare against Taylor Swift. She could very well choose to ignore them. To stay above the fray. To spend 2024 selling out stadiums worldwide via the Eras Tour. To let the conspiracy theorists continue to dissemble. If I were Taylor Swift, I wouldn't dignify the MAGA world with a response or reaction anytime soon. Instead, I'd let the campaigns unfold. Then, come fall, when it would matter most, when MAGA has moved on, when everyone has forgotten the insanity of the past few weeks, in a few strategic states that will decide the next election, maybe, just maybe, Swift should extract her revenge.

Serenity Arce (4-CHAIR TURN)Age: 16Hometown: Jupiter, FLResident: Jupiter, FL Serenity, at just 14 years old, auditioned for Season 21 but didn't get any chairs to turn. The coaches gave her feedback to practice more and grow as a vocalist. She was involved in musical theater, which Ariana appreciated and believed was a great place for vocal growth. After her audition, Serenity focused on finding her voice and taking weekly vocal lessons. She booked small gigs at local events to gain exposure and practice her skills. She now works at a local boba café to cover expenses and recently got her driver's license. Dance remains an important part of her life and she participates in a few dance teams, practicing multiple times a week. 2. Dani Stacy (4-CHAIR TURN)Age: 31Hometown: Hanford, CAResident: Nashville, TN Dani began writing songs at 13 when she got her first guitar but mostly kept her music private. After moving to Ventura to attend Cal State Channel Islands, she started to branch out by participating in open mic nights and jam sessions, and even briefly joining a reggae band. She started ""Artist's Brew"" in her apartment complex, where she would book friends to play their original music and be among other musicians and creatives. In 2016, Dani moved to a house in Encino where she and her roommates would host live shows called ""LowerDeck Sessions."" It evolved from 10 friends jamming together to 150+ people attending the house shows monthly. In 2020, Dani moved to Nashville to pursue songwriting. She started doing writers' rounds and met her boyfriend, who plays bass in a rock band, which would eventually become her backing band. She and her boyfriend now travel the country in their camper, performing at stops along the way. 3. Maddi Jane (4-CHAIR TURN)Age: 24Hometown: Chicago, ILResident: Los Angeles, CA Maddi Jane's upbringing focused on Christian Youth Theatre, shaping her passion for the arts, and homeschooling with her parents, who hold PhDs in psychology.

She launched the natural hair care line in 2023 and is already seeing success in her orders. Nadège moved to California in 2020 to join the Bible College at Oceans Church, which provided Nadège with a sense of direction in her life, spirit and her career in music as an artist. It was Nadège's dad who inspired her to get into music. He dabbled in music production when he was young and helped Nadège in the studio when she started to make music as a teen. Nadège's mom was also heavily involved in the music industry as a makeup artist. In recent years, Nadège has focused on singing and leading worship at Oceans Church and is now ready to step back into the music industry after graduating from Oceans College. 5. RLETTO (2-CHAIR TURN)Age: 27Hometown: Orlando, FLResident: Los Angeles, CA RLETTO created his stage name in an artist development class by combining the first letter of his name with his last name and adding an ""O"" at the end to let the name roll off the tongue a bit better. RLETTO took on band, choir and drama early in high school and then auditioned for Berklee College of Music, where he received a scholarship that granted him 75% of his four-year program. After graduating, he started to book large music festivals, music video shoots and recording sessions to establish a name for himself, all while saving money to move to Los Angeles. RLETTO has now been in L.A. since 2022 and has had the honor of working as a talent assistant for MTV Push, Cardi B, Lil Nas X, BET and more. RLETTO discovered his love for combining melodic rap and singing, which he is excited to bring to ""The Voice."" 6. Kamalei Kawa'a (2-CHAIR TURN)Age: 26Hometown: Paukukalo, HIResident: Paukukalo, HI Kamalei is a native Hawaiian from Maui, and the island's culture and heritage play a huge part in his everyday life. He acquired the art of hula from his mother at a young age. In high school, he and his brother started a band, ""Na Wai ?Eha, named after the four famous waters of Maui. They performed in Japan, up and down the West Coast, and around the islands of Hawaii. They even received a Grammy nomination in the regional roots category. Kamalei started performing solo in 2021 and has since released two singles. During the day, he teaches Hawaiian Studies and Hula, while he pursues his passion as a musician at night. Kamalei lives on Hawaiian Homelands in Maui with his wife and daughter.

Alyssa Crosby (1-CHAIR TURN) - STOLEN IN BATTLESAge: 32Hometown: Binghamton, NYResident: Binghamton, NY Alyssa is a self-proclaimed cat lady. When Alyssa is not performing on stage, you can usually find her at home with her fiancé, five cats and puppy. Alyssa loves to write songs and sometimes serenade her animals with her music. Having grown up around singers, Alyssa's mother had a deep connection to music and started her own karaoke business when Alyssa was just a kid. Alyssa enjoyed karaoke throughout most of her life, and when she was in her early 20s decided to start a band. Putting out an ad on Craigslist for more band members was just the start of her current band, WildCard. All the other band members are men in their 50s, but she enjoys holding her own as the only woman on the stage. Gabriel Goes (1-CHAIR TURN) - ELIMINATED IN BATTLESAge: 21Hometown: Honolulu, HIResident: Honolulu, HI Gabriel's upbringing immersed him in the arts, with his father as a renowned photographer and filmmaker and his mother running an aerialist school. When he was 3, his mom started taking him to shows and would always seat Gabriel in the band section. He loved watching all the musicians and immediately fell in love. Soon he picked up singing and playing the ukulele and guitar. In high school, he formed a rock/reggae band called Backset and Gabriel writes all their original music. They play private parties, graduations, fairs and clubs. Growing up in Hawaii, Gabriel participated in surfing, sailing, wakeboarding and free diving, a skill he adopted from his late father, who passed away in an accident when Gabriel was 6. Being in the ocean makes Gabriel feel closer to his dad. Gabriel may have very few memories of his father, but if it's one lesson he has taken from him, it is to spend time doing the things he loves. Bri Fletcher (1-CHAIR TURN) - ELIMINATED IN BATTLESAge: 28Hometown: Fort Worth, TXResident: Nashville, TN Bri turned to music growing up as a coping mechanism after she experienced bullying in high school. She ended up graduating early so she could pursue music full-time. Bri has since been inspired to speak out against bullying and even created her own anti-bullying foundation, ""DeBully."" She would travel around Texas sharing anti-bullying messages and performing empowering songs. Gaining confidence as a musician and songwriter, Bri moved to Nashville in 2018 with her husband, Zak. Now Bri has over 3.6 million streams on her music, performs all over Nashville and hosts an all-girl-performance night at Ole Red. Corey Curtis (1-CHAIR TURN) - ELIMINATED IN BATTLESAge: 22Hometown: Summerville, GAResident: Saraland, AL Corey's musical journey began when he joined his church band, where he taught himself how to play the drums. After the band separated, he taught himself three more instruments, including the guitar. Once he started coming into his voice, he started to write his own songs. The first song he ever wrote, titled ""Broken,"" moved his mother and ignited his passion for music. Corey says his relationship with his mother, who he credits as his biggest supporter, was a driving force for his pursuit of success. Corey grew up in Georgia, but later moved to Alabama to move in with his brother and, hopefully, find more open doors and musical opportunities. He has accumulated over 620,000 streams across all music platforms and has gained a following on TikTok with 29,600 followers, all while showcasing his talent through gigging and busking in more than 10 states.

"March 7, 2024",Tesla Cybertruck offroading on California beach ends with a glitch,218,"  Tesla describes its Cybertruck as a durable and rugged vehicle that can go anywhere, but one Nevada man learned this week that's not always the case after his truck became stuck on a state beach in Monterey County. The incident occurred on Monday at Marina State Beach when the owner of the Cybertruck drove over a curb and sidewalk and past a posted sign stating ""no vehicles on beach or dunes,"" according to Douglas Johnson, information officer with the California State Parks.  ""The Cybertruck soon got stuck,"" he said. ""With assistance from the Marina Fire Department the vehicle was able to get out by releasing air from the tires."" KSBW Action News 8 posted a video on its TikTok account. The video was taken by a woman at the beach and shows a state park officer talking to three men near the Cybertruck. In the video the woman and others laugh as the men push the truck out of the beach. Johnson said the driver was fined $280.  The incident happened just a day after a Tesla Cybertruck crashed into the front sign of the Beverly Hills Hotel on Sunday night, prompting social media responses from the hotel and Tesla founder Elon Musk.   A user of X, formerly Twitter, had joked in a post that the hotel valet had crashed his friend's Cybertruck. Musk responded to the post: ""Cyberbeast is faster than a Porsche 911, but looks like a truck, so perhaps the valet wasn't expecting so much acceleration.""  The posts prompted the hotel to clarify that the hotel's valet was not involved in the incident.  This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"April 8, 2024",The 'flat croissant' is a pastry abomination. I'm eating them anyway,219,"  I am a serious newspaper food columnist. I am not tempted by the next viral pastry trend. I will not spend money on something simply because it is larger or smaller than it should be, or a hybrid of two things I like. Also me: I spent an hour in traffic to drive to a bakery in Koreatown because someone I follow on Instagram posted a video of a ""flat"" croissant. The flat croissant looks like an optical illusion. A cartoon croissant squashed by a boulder. A magic trick or something out of a Harry Potter newspaper. Imagine reaching your hand into an Osias Beert or Pieter Claesz painting and plucking out one of the lifelike foods on the canvas.  It's about 1 millimeter thick and made by a machine that both presses and cooks the croissant. The flattened result yields a surface that brings to mind the beautiful sandstone striations of the Wave in Northern Arizona. It is a pastry abomination that subverts the very idea of a croissant, the prized contrast of delicate pastry shell and ultra fluffy center. A TikTok search will yield videos with millions of views featuring flat croissants at various bakeries in Korea where the trend first took hold. According to Eater SF, you can also find flat croissants at a bakery in the Bay Area. I was first introduced to the pastry by Jae Hwa Yu, who goes by the name MissPiggieEats on social media. Yu recently posted a video of the croissant, called keu-loong-gi at Coin de Rue, a cheery bakery in the heart of Koreatown. I expected the croissants to have their own display, or at least a presentation that matched the online fervor. On a recent visit, I found them stacked in the pastry case alongside some white bread and sugar doughnuts.  The woman behind the counter used a pair of tongs to carefully remove one of the croissants ($3) and place it in its own plastic sleeve. She also gave me a small container of whipped cream for dipping. ""Oh no!"" she exclaimed. A small corner broke off when she placed the croissant on the counter. ""I broke it. I'll get you another one."" Like a 3-D croissant, the 2-D version smells buttery. The crust is brittle but not so delicate that it shatters. The entire thing tastes like that one crisp shard you peel off the top of a good croissant.  Pastry chef Rachel Lee said she makes the croissants with a special press her father, owner Hyo Sang Lee, bought from Korea. The unproofed croissant dough is sprinkled with rock sugar and then both cooked through and smashed in the press. The croissants never see the inside of an oven.  Though Lee uses a hot press, I found multiple other flat croissant cooking methods online. Some bakeries flatten the raw croissant dough then bake the croissants under a heavy sheet pan to hold the shape. I also watched countless videos of people making their own versions at home, smashing baked croissants with a rolling pin then toasting both sides in a hot pan.  But none seemed as flat as Lee's. At most, you can see two layers. All the lamination in the dough is compacted beyond the scope of the naked eye. And when you bite it, it's as crunchy as a cracker.  ""Our customers are already into popular croissants so my dad thought why not try a different texture instead of being cream-filled or something like that,"" she said. ""And he wanted to do something that wasn't already familiar around L.A.""  While the bakery has been open for three years, Lee said they just introduced the croissants about six months ago.  ""I'll see people contemplating the 3-D versus the 2-D, but a lot of people get both,"" Lee said.  I cracked the croissant into large tiles, then dipped them in the whipped cream. One end was thicker than the other by maybe half a millimeter, allowing for the tiniest bit of chew to remain. The more I ate, the more I thought the word ""abomination"" was too severe an assessment. What if I looked at the flat croissant as the best part of a croissant, maximized? Like a muffin top. The bottom of a chocolate-filled ice cream cone. The crunchy edge of a pan of brownies. The first three seconds of a bite of kouign-amann. Unless you like the middle part best. Then you should just buy a croissant.  This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times. Link to Image Graphic    The flat croissant from Coin de Rue in Koreatown.

"January 17, 2024",The (Abridged) Dictionary of Maxxing,220,"  Our editors independently select the products we recommend. We may earn a commission on items bought through our links. ""Maxxing"" is a concept that bubbled up from the ooze of Reddit Incel forums and 4Chan before metastasizing into a toxically obsessive lifestyle choice. Philosophically speaking, Maxxing is the idea that total optimization for sexual conquest is possible. Practically speaking, it's a distinctly male justification for splashing out on beauty products (and self-care more broadly). Now that Maxxing is TikTok lingua franca, there's ""healthmaxxing,"" ""mentalitymaxxing,"" ""moneymaxxing,"" and, most ubiquitously, ""looksmaxxing."" Each term has been trending upward on Google as, it seems, more and more men go all in on exercise, diet, and lotions. Can women maxx? Yes, but it's not entirely clear what that would mean in practice given that women account for roughly 80% of the beauty market (i.e. skincare, fragrance, makeup, and haircare). Maxxing is really a masculine description of traditionally female consumer behaviors. It's also an opportunity for anyone ""who can make money in any way"" off the insecurities of women to broaden their reach. That's according to Cynthia Bulik, a psychologist at the University of North Carolina's School of Medicine who specializes in eating disorders. Maxxing is good news for the fashion, beauty and diet industries, Bulik says, ""It's easier to make women feel insecure about their appearance, but to be profitable with men, it has to be a competition."" According to Bulik, Maxxing ""encourages obsessive preoccupation with perceived or manufactured physical deficiencies, may feed directly into body dysmorphia, impact both body-esteem and self-esteem, and can lead to extreme and dangerous behaviors to maximally 'correct' whatever the deficiency of the day is."" Some TikTok Stats: ""Looksmaxing,"" ""looksmaxing,"" ""lookmaxxing,"" ""lookmax,"" and ""looksmaxxingincel"" combined have over 1.7 billion views on TikTok. The sub-maxxings: ""Stylemaxxing,"" ""healthmaxxing,"" ""bodymaxxing,"" ""bonemaxxing,"" ""skincaremaxxing"" and ""hairmaxxing,"" have over 40 million views together on TikTok. ""Maxxing"" and ""maxing"" are at about 70 million views together.  Angela Lee, a consumer psychologist at Northwestern University, says ""maxxing"" echoes the concept of ""maximizers vs. satisficers,"" which breaks decisionmakers into two categories: Those who want to make the right or ""best possible"" decision for maximum benefit and those who want to make any decision that leads to a relatively basic result. Studies suggest that maximizers tend to be less happy with their consumer decisions. They also tend to have lower self-esteem. That's not to say that Maxxing is all bad. Getting into better shape can, within the bounds of reason, be a very good thing. Health is good. Confidence is good. But anything taken to an illogical extreme can get ugly. For instance, a trend among Looksmaxxers: Face smashing. It's exactly what it sounds like. Some too-online maxxers are smashing their faces with hammers to reshape their bone structure. There are a lot of TikToks and forum dialogues about this practice as well as - pretty predictably - a lot of horror stories about home surgeries gone wrong. Some of those are from men who discovered the hard way that hitting oneself with a hammer doesn't actually alter bone structure; others are from men who bought filler off the dark web or tried to remove buccal fat from their own faces. Maxxing is ultimately, as Bulik says, a form of competition and competitions tend to lend themselves to extreme behaviors. But then there are also the 21-year-olds on TikTok with millions of followers pushing organic shampoo or waxing poetic about gua sha facial massages. Whether Gua Sha, a hugely popular trend with women, really works or not, there's no serious danger there - just men learning to consume like women. Someone is making money on those jade rollers, but at least no one is going to the hospital. Men and the Beauty Market Stats about how much men actually invest in beauty products aren't so straightforward. One study conducted by LendingTree last year found that globally, women purchased beauty products online more than men. An average of 38% of women purchased beauty products online every month, compared to about a quarter of men. The same study found that men spend more annually on beauty than women - $2,256 a year compared to $1,283 a year. A 2023 Deloitte analysis suggests that men tend to spend more than they splurge, which may help explain the disparity. One Advanced Dermatology survey, though, found that (American) men spend an average of $592 per year on their appearance - $285 less than women, only outspending women in fitness categories. A recent Groupon survey has similar findings. The number of men getting cosmetic surgeries is increasing.

"March 12, 2024",The Bizarre Future of Batman Toys,223,"  Our editors independently select the products we recommend. We may earn a commission on items bought through our links. Winnie-the-Pooh and Mickey Mouse were canaries in the copyright coal mine. When the characters entered the public domain over the last two years, they inspired honey-pot horror movies and Mickey Mouse Does 9/11 memes. There's money to be made off the available IP, but honestly not much. That will change over the next 13 years as DC heavyweights Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman all enter the public domain. There will be movies, TV shows, 60-part TikTok holiday specials, and legal battles, but there will also be wild new merch and a lot of it. The key stipulation with characters entering the public domain is that certain versions do it one at a time, after 95 years of copyright protection. So expect an adorable BatMickey plush in Disney stores come 2035. Expect a Deadpool crossover action figure. Fans may be excited, but intellectual property lawyers should be pumped, too.  When the original version of a story or character becomes public domain, copyright law will generally allow the public to use that original version freely, Louis W. Tompros, a law professor at Harvard University specializing in IP law, tells SPY. So Batman entering the public domain in 2035 will be the 1939 version of the character. That Batman has a utility belt, as well as a helicopter-like ""Bat-Gyro,"" and a fiancé named Julie. No Riddler, Joker, or Robin in sight - yet.  ""But if they wanted to try to stop copies of later versions... they would easily be able to use copyright law to stop that,"" explains Tompros. The obvious rub here is that an ""original version"" of a character isn't always clear-cut. How much could a rival studio adapt OG Batman into a realistic, modern-day character without organically arriving at a version similar to Warner Bros. Discovery's? Doesn't it make sense that a real-life billionaire superhero would run around in an armored suit instead of spandex?  ""The test is 'substantial similarity,'"" Tompros says. ""Specifically, setting aside everything that is in the original public domain 'Batman.' Are the features of the new movie 'substantially similar' to other features of the 2005-2012 or 2016-2021 versions? An all-black armored suit might be enough to count as 'substantially similar' to a later version. Ultimately, how close counts as 'substantial' is a question for a jury to decide on a case-by-case basis."" When it comes to merchandising, the bigger issue is trademark, which prohibits misleading consumers about the source of a product, according to Duke University. Trademark law prevents someone from selling something that uses a set of words or characters - such as ""Batman"" - that would suggest it came from someone else, in this case, Warner Bros, Tompros says. So a Batman logo is a landmine. But something like BatMickey becomes more and more likely. A cowl, a cape, a portmanteau - those are good enough clues for consumers to get their Batman fix without Disney, in this case, actually violating a trademark.  ""As long as movie or TV [creators] use that imagery without calling them that name, then that would be fair game,"" Alex Grand, author of Understanding Superhero Comic Books, tells SPY. ""The big companies could try to suppress that, but probably couldn't.""  Rebecca Tushnet, a Harvard Law School Professor specializing in copyright law, says that Sherlock Holmes is a good example of the type of headache Batman might cause in a few years.  With Sherlock Holmes - whose first stories entered the public domain in 1981 and whose last stories only did last year - ""claimants to the estate have long harassed people making their own SH stories based on public domain works,"" Tushnet says. As one example, the estate would claim that having Holmes show emotion was infringing on later stories - ones that were still in copyright - where he did so. ""And if you make merchandise, you may face DC/Warner Bros. arguing that consumers would believe that the merchandise came from them, even if you're just using public domain elements of Batman,"" she adds.  But people will still try to make merch. In 2011, for example, Warner Bros. successfully prevented nostalgia merchandise company AVELA from using public domain promotional images from The Wizard of Oz to make shirts, lunch boxes, and music box lids.  With all due respect to Dorothy and the Cowardly Lion, superhero merch may prove too lucrative to resist attempting. In 2016, the last year Warner Bros. released such a figure, the company said that it made $4.5 billion in DC Comics merchandise sales. That's more than DC movies made that year - Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad earned about $1.6 billion cumulatively. The US toy market is expected to grow to about $46.19 billion by 2030, from $30.61 billion in 2023, growing at a CAGR of 6.05%, according to Research and Markets. And the retro toy market is thriving currently, with companies like Lego and Mattel shifting strategies to target adult nostalgia.  Which is all to say, it might be worthwhile for a company to piss off Warner Bros. Discovery once Batman 1.0 becomes a free agent. A homicidal clown once said, ""It's not about money... it's about sending a message."" Sure, but also...money.

"March 22, 2024",The Breakdown: Why Does Helen Levi's Beach Mug Cost $64?,225,"  Our editors independently select the products we recommend. We may earn a commission on items bought through our links. Helen Levi, a 36-year-old ceramics artist based in Ridgewood, Queens, can't stop thinking about a recent influencer drama on TikTok. It involved a creator wanting to buy a mug at a craft sale and balking at the price tag: $125.  ""The comment section was full of people complaining that it wasn't even made by hand, but by a mold,"" Levi tells SPY. ""People think that the only way something can be good is if it's made entirely by hand, which is not worth glamorizing.""  It's the kind of misconception that she wants to clear up. For every TikTok or Instagram video about an artist making something for a small business - resin coasters, vases, crocheted sweaters - is a comment section filled with people who don't understand how labor and cost-intensive it is to make something at that scale. (As one viral sound goes: ""It costs that much because it takes me fucking hours."")  Levi has been running her store for 11 years, which has developed a cult following. Her most popular item is the ""Beach Daily Mug,"" which is 14 ounces and features a unique blue-and-white marbling on each one, running $64. She says that the price point is emblematic of all the other costs across her production and product line, which includes tiles, plates, and clocks.  ""I think the best way to explain the pricing of one piece is to step back and look at all the pieces,"" she says.  Levi took SPY through why the mug costs what it does - and why between training, shipping, rent, and fluid production costs, overhead for small-production artists isn't an exact science. Rent Rent was the simplest cost for Levi to put an exact number on. Her 1,000-square-foot studio in Queens costs $3,600 a month, a size and price range she worked up to over a decade. She started in a shared studio space with other artists, eventually moving to Ridgewood in 2019, where she and two assistants handle the pottery, shipping, and sales.  ""I want to pull back the curtain because people look on Instagram and see the large space and assume I must have taken out a big loan or have family money to afford it, when the reality is that I just grew the business slowly,"" she says. ""There's this starving artist legend - it's not easy to make money doing this but it is a real career and I want people to know this can be done.""  Materials The cost of materials varies, but as an example, in 2023, Levi bought:  63 20 cubic foot bags of packing peanuts ($2,100 a year) 324 gallons of liquid casting slip, a material she uses for the mug and other products (Levi didn't have exact numbers, but that usually runs between about $15,000 and $20,000, depending on which type) 24 gallons of clear glaze - also for multiple products ($500 to $800, according to the market, also depending on which type) Levi also pays to lease a paper pad machine and a cardboard shredding machine that produces packing materials, each of which costs $25 a month.  ""And we have special stamps at the bottom of the mug that cost money,"" she adds. ""We also sand the mug to make sure there are no sharp edges - how many sanding pads do I go through a year? There are all sorts of small costs that just add up.""  Production  Levi makes thousands of products a year - being conservative, she says she made 5,000 in 2023. As with anything else, pricing is about scale, which is hard to plan, given that she's often guessing how much she'll need to produce. She has to outsource part of the production of her plates, for instance, to a company with a RAM pressing machine. She's charged a fixed cost when she places an order, so she orders a full kiln-load and stores them after, glazing them, firing them again, and selling them gradually.  When the mug launched in 2018, she priced it at $58; now, it sells for $64. A year and a half ago, the stoneware slip required to make it was $15 per box; now it's $22.70 per box. Packing peanuts were $22 per bag four years ago, and now they're $35 per bag.  She makes stoneware slip and plaster molds for the mugs, which have a limited lifespan - that means making the molds, using them 50 to 70 times, and then starting a new mold, all of which are labor and materials-intensive.  ""The reason it's hard to calculate an exact price is because of how much loss you have in the process - a mug can crack before you fire it,"" she says, estimating that the slip, the mason stain she uses, and the plaster mold all cost a few dollars each. That's on top of a few dollars in electricity costs a few dollars every time she fires something in the kiln, and the cost to repair and replace a kiln every so often.  ""A mug takes three minutes to throw on the wheel because I've been doing this for about 20 years, but there's so much more [to it] than that,"" she says.  She adds that she's often eating the cost of a mug because of consumer expectations.  ""It's based on the market,"" she says. ""Even if I could sell a mug for $150, I would want people to use it. I want it to be functional. If someone's not a potter, they don't know that a handled mug takes way longer to do than a tumbler - molding it, smoothing it, sanding it, and making sure it attaches well. Customers don't know it takes twice as much time. My tumbler is more profitable because it's sold for a similar price.""  Staff  Levi's starting wage for employees is $24 an hour, and they get raises over time, she says. They typically work 24 hours a week, a number that goes up to 40 as the holiday months approach.  Shipping ""I really started a packing and shipping company when I started a studio,"" Levi says. ""My friends who make fabric-based things like tote bags - they just take thirty seconds to print out the label and put it in a mailer.""  Her studio's breakage rate is way below half of 1%, she says, because they invest in specialized materials - the two machines she leases in the basement, two or three dozen sizes of boxes, paper tape for the outside of the box, plate sleeves for when people order dinner plates. It's hard to separate those costs from any one item, especially when she's often eating expenses for larger orders that take more time and materials to put together - and then cost more to ship.  Profit  It's ""totally impossible"" to figure out the profit margin for a mug until the end of a year, she says, because there are some years she loses money and some years she makes some off of it.  ""It's an averages thing,"" Levi says. ""I'm probably not the shrewdest business person because I know it's working, since I have enough money to live my life. My business is at a small enough scale where I never borrowed money, so every year I grow a little based on my income and expenses,"" is as specific as she gets.  ""My idea is, if people like a mug they'll come back when they can save up and buy something like plates,"" she says, which customers typically buy. in larger sets. ""Me throwing a large mug on a wheel isn't much different than a small mug on a wheel, cost-wise, but you charge more because people expect a big mug to cost more and a small mug to cost less,"" she says.

"March 26, 2024",The Conga Room welcomed Latin luminaries for 25 years. Why club founders say it's time to let it rest,226,"  For one more night, the papaya bar still beckons at the Conga Room in downtown L.A. The yellow sculptural design from Cuban American artist Jorge Pardo - meant to resemble the tropical fruit split open - has served cocktails to Latin music lovers since this incarnation of the Conga Room opened at L.A. Live in 2008, a decade after the club debuted in Miracle Mile. The murals of angelic luchadors, from artist Sergio Arau, are still up for now, as are the ceiling panels meant to resemble a cascade of flowers. ""This thing is not evergreen,"" said co-founder Brad Gluckstein, looking over a wall of portraits and concert shots taken on the Conga Room's stage. ""But it's allowing a really exhilarating transition, as opposed to just longing for what was. Twenty-five years is a long run."" The Conga Room will go dark forever on Wednesday with what's expected to be a rowdy, teary send-off show. The closure marks the end of a chapter in local Latin music, one in which the Conga Room cultivated multiple generations of stars and brought titans of music history through its doors, from Celia Cruz to Bad Bunny, Los Van Van to J Balvin. The music that the Conga Room has championed since the '90s has never been more popular globally. Amid the success of Latin music on stadium tours, festival stages and streaming platforms, the venue's founders are making peace with what that has meant for their nightlife niche. They can reflect on the impact that the Conga Room had - and why it's time to let it rest. ""All that's happening right now in front of us is probably, to a certain degree, because of us,"" Gluckstein said. ""I don't think LeBron's scoring record will ever be broken, and I have a hard time believing that in Los Angeles, you'll see a run with the same success that we had."" Gluckstein and his co-founder, ""NYPD Blue"" and ""L.A. Law"" actor Jimmy Smits, are sifting through decades of memories. In the green room, Gluckstein has a photo album in which his much-younger self poses with Jennifer Lopez and Willie Colón, the Boricua salsa music titan. Smits laughed as he recalled one overpacked night where he got roped into manning security detail at the height of his TV fame. Both reverently recalled Prince cornering them backstage before a gig to advocate for artists to get paid when DJs spun their records.  ""It's been like losing a family member,"" Smits said. ""I came here from New York and was searching out any kind of tropical music. On any given night, you could come and see people wearing cowboy hats, or people dancing their asses off for reggaeton nights. Sheila E was involved from the beginning, and one of my fondest memories was Prince taking the stage here. The club was able to give voice to a kind of panorama of what Latino music can be."" When the Conga Room first opened in 1998, Latin music was in one of its waves of commercial success among wider audiences. Celebrities such as comedian Paul Rodriguez, singer Tito Nieves and record label owner Ralph Mercado signed on as investors to open the 400-capacity room, within walking distance of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Ricky Martin and Lopez (another co-investor) were ascendant pop stars, and rock en español acts such as Maná were winning acclaim. The Selena biopic brought fresh attention to the late Tejana star's music, and in 1999, Wim Wenders' documentary on the Cuban group Buena Vista Social Club renewed global interest in the Latin music of the Caribbean. On opening night in 1998, when Cuban singer Celia Cruz headlined, The Times noted that ""a very interesting paradox ... lies at the heart of the venue: A lot of money has been spent to re-create the smoky atmosphere of the kind of Cuban clubs that were originally geared toward the working class. Of course, bring somebody like Cruz on stage and the whole evening turns into a family affair."" ""We were doing things that nobody had ever done on the West Coast,"" Gluckstein said. ""We had a steady diet of Cuban music, Los Van Van and Pablo Milanés. We had gigantic salseros who would normally play to 10,000 people in Colombia or Venezuela. We were privileged to be able to feature them, and they were excited because of the sound quality and the way we treated artists."" The club became a favorite spot for politicians to mingle, and it hosted the Democratic National Convention kickoff party in 2000 with Bill Clinton and Al Gore attending. It hosted the Latin Grammys after the 9/11 attacks canceled plans at the Forum. When the club migrated to the freshly constructed L.A. Live after a two-year hiatus, what had been an intimate spot for music discovery turned into a gleaming showcase for Latin music at the heart of downtown's sports and music megaplex. ""Our first venue was a hole in the wall,"" said Gluckstein, fondly. ""Despite the trappings of L.A. Live, how clean and industrial this complex is, we dreamt big."" Oscar Hernandez, leader of the Spanish Harlem Orchestra, came on as music director. The venue also diversified from its salsa roots, giving the actor Jamie Foxx's R&B band a long-standing residency, and booking early gigs from Ed Sheeran and Avicii. As the wave of reggaeton and música urbana began to crest, the Conga Room booked some of the first L.A. shows for Maluma, J Balvin and Bad Bunny. ""Bad Bunny canceled his tour's club dates the day after our venue,"" Gluckstein said. ""We were really advanced. You never saw him in a club again."" ""The music changes, that's the beauty,"" Smits said. ""Latinos like how the influence of the older styles of music gets mixed in. We've tried to preserve those tropical nights, but to give exposure to different genres of Latin music. When it started with reggaeton and how hip-hop influenced the whole way this music is perceived, we adapted."" Yet the club's prospects dimmed, like it did for so many others, when the pandemic hit.  ""We were killing it before the pandemic. Our club nights were off the charts, and we were booking a lot of events,"" Gluckstein said.  But they returned to find younger fans' nightlife habits had changed, right as acts like Bad Bunny were headlining Coachella and Mexican music acts like Peso Pluma and Fuerza Regida became megastars on TikTok. ""Artists are having a hard time making a living other than what they're getting paid to do concerts. So that ratchets up the price to make tours more viable,"" Gluckstein said. ""I think it's become talent-based and not club-centric. Kids aren't going to big dance halls as much. If they do see a Latin concert, they're going to the Forum."" Gluckstein said that after 25 years running nightclubs, he wanted to concentrate more on his youth charity, Conga Kids, which brings Latin music and dance classes to 50,000 local youth. But first he will memorialize one of the foundational venues in modern Latin music. At the Wednesday party, Gov. Gavin Newsom will appear in a sendoff video, and a who's-who of politicians including Sen. Alex Padilla, former Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and state education Superintendent Tony Thurmond will speak. Gilberto Santa Rosa, fondly known as ""El Caballero de la Salsa,"" will lead a 16-piece orchestra, and the night will wrap with a jam session led by Jerry Rivera (""El Bebé de la Salsa"") and Santana's singer, Andy Vargas. Latin music is at its most exciting zenith in U.S. since the late '90s, when the Conga Room debuted. Gluckstein and Smits said they'll part ways with the venue with no regrets. But who will take the papaya bar home? Gluckstein laughed and said maybe he would. ""Only if we have enough ground in our backyard and it can deal with rain,"" he said. ""It's a fickle city.""

"April 3, 2024","The family that laughs together ... The Lopez family heals on-, off-screen; ... gets a new season to work out their issues. George and Mayan Lopez discuss when art imitates life.",228,"  Debby Wolfe hadn't exactly planned to find the inspiration for a family sitcom while doom-scrolling TikTok. But in the wee hours one night, during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, another compulsive swipe up on her phone screen led to a video from Mayan Lopez, the daughter of comedian George Lopez. The younger Lopez -- also a comedian who, for years, had been estranged from her father -- was clearing up some rumors about her parents divorce ... while twerking upside down. ""Mayan had inherited her father's comedy chops -- she knew what was funny about her struggles and her pain and was able to poke fun at it,"" Wolfe says. Sure, OK. But if this was a scene from a mockumentary sitcom, the camera would zoom in on George, who is sitting next to Mayan and Wolfe, and is shaking his head like a proud but defeated father being reminded of his daughter's rump shaking. This isn't a Danny and D.J. Tanner-type family dynamic. But perhaps the father-daughter dysfunction in ""Lopez vs. Lopez"" may be more relatable and just as heartwarming and soothing. Created by Wolfe and the Lopez duo, the meta family comedy stars George and Mayan as fictional versions of themselves as they attempt to mend their fractured relationship. Their characters share their names, but not occupations: Mayan works at a veterinarian's office and George has a moving company, but it goes bankrupt, prompting George to move in with Mayan. It resembles what happened to their family in real life: When the pandemic hit, Mayan and her mother Ann, George's ex-wife who was also an executive producer on ""George Lopez,"" were worried about him -- he is immunocompromised -- so they came together during stay-at-home orders. And the healing began. The arguments and growing pains continue as the working-class family comedy returned for its 10-episode sophomore season, premiering Tuesday on NBC in back-to-back episodes. From the show's set on NBC's famed Universal Studios lot, Wolfe joined George and Mayan to talk about being the only Latino-centered series on broadcast television right now, how George's relationship with alcohol is explored in the new season, and navigating boundaries when art imitates life. This conversation has been edited for clarity and length. -- InLatino culture, you don't usually air dirty laundry about the family out in public. Mayan, what compelled you to do it? Mayan: I've been in therapy since I was very, very young. I like to think of comedy as tragedy and time. And just enough time has passed. During the pandemic, it was such a horrible time for everyone and everyone just wanted to connect. We weren't speaking very much at that time, but I was talking about my issues with my family and mental health and what having a father that wasn't really present [was like], how that affected my identity and how I integrated that into my comedy, and also the reconciliation. I think what helped sell the show was the numbers behind some of the videos and their success. My dad is immunocompromised; my mom donated a kidney to my dad 17 years ago. During that time where people were going apart, we came together. I did a whole series of ""Why do my divorced parents still act like they're married?"" The first one got 60 million views. Culturally, yeah, we don't air that stuff out. But that's part of some of the issues with our community is that the generational trauma and the machismo isn't addressed. I see ""Lopez vs. Lopez"" as a show for everyone, but also a love letter to our community. -- George, as somebody who that has mined your own life for your comedy, could you understand why Mayan would do the same? George: I understand completely. Talking about my life wasn't going to be my process. In the early '90s, before Tim Allen got ""Home Improvement,"" he had a special on Showtime. I saw him right before he was going to do the pilot; he did like an hour and 15 minutes -- it was brilliant. All that was in the show was in his act. I remember standing in the back room thinking, ""Man, I don't think I have anything like that."" Over the next 10 years, Dave Becky [a comedian manager] told me at Carolines in the early '90s: ""Your act doesn't really tell me anything about yourself."" I was trying to just be a comedian. Once I started to talk about my grandmother, Vicks, hot dog with a piece of sandwich bread wrapped around it -- I mean all those kinds of jokes are what you see in memes now. -- Was it a tough sell for you, the idea of doing a show with your daughter? George: I thought it was animation. Debby: You did? For real? Mayan: He called me and was like, ""Is this going to be an animated 'Gilmore Girls'?"" Because he was like, ""There's no way that they're going to allow a real father and daughter to talk like that to each other."" George: When you're orange, you can say anything. Mayan: That was something that was very interesting, because there's no rule book; there's nothing that could prepare me to have a scene partner who's not only my father, but someone that's caused me pain, and I'm playing a version of myself. It's personal and it's about finding the right amount of separation to try to protect yourself, but also play the character to the best of their ability. We've both been very brave with this and I think that's also the comedic and the performer aspect that I've learned from him and seen growing up by seeing how he's gone into his art. My dad will take the script, and he'll rewrite it and it's more personal to our real-life experience and some things that come out in that script I've never heard from him. Debby: Mayan saying how, in the show, they say things to each other that they haven't said to one another in real life -- I think it's very powerful. I think it's been healing not only to them, personally, but also healing for the audience. -- If this started with the TikTok videos of you, Mayan, trying to heal and process everything, what has it been like for you, George, doing this show with her? How has it been healing for you? George: I take responsibility, but also, I had a very difficult upbringing without a mother, without my father. In order to save yourself, you have to put a wall around your emotions -- good and bad because I just don't even know what would happen if I didn't. I didn't react to many things, good or bad. I remember, when I was 7 years old, I signed up for Little League late and all the boys were picked. I went to the guy from the league, and he said, ""If I can find a team that needs somebody, I'll call you."" So he called me: ""I found a team for you. Aren't you excited? Let me hear you scream."" And I didn't know how to be excited. I was like, ""OK."" I couldn't. I was 7. But I understand it now. Debby: George really surprised me with how sensitive he is. Just talking with you about your relationship with Mayan and everything, I've seen you in tears. George: When we did, I think it was maybe a Christmas show, and I said to Selenis [Leyva, who plays George's ex-wife, Rosie, on the series], ""I'm gonna say one line toward the end."" I didn't tell her what it was. But it was about me drinking. I said to her [Selenis]: ""You know, I'm not bad..."" I'm not bad. I've never seen a real, connected family in my family. Mayan: As me, and my character, I have been able to see my dad as a person. Even through therapy, yes, I see that he's had this childhood and these things that have affected and changed who he is, and that's helped us and now we get to enjoy one another and, with this show, we're making up for lost time. George: If Mayan and Debby were men, this show would not be what it is. The success of this show is that it was created by women who are emotional and vulnerable and know how to make you feel this connection with issues around family that everybody goes through. It's nothing unusual. -- Debby, what do you remember about those early conversations with the two of them and deciding how to set this foundation for what the tone would be? Debby: I actually talked to them separately. I wanted to get both sides of the story. They both had just such different perspectives. It's generational. He had these old-school ideas and Mayan is modern, Gen Z-like. She's very therapized and George is ... he's kind of therapized. Mayan: He's gotten better. George: Hey, I don't hardly see you outside of here, so, I would say I'm much better. Debby: They're still healing. They're still growing. It makes sense to me to that Mayan grew up on the set of the original ""George Lopez"" show, so it seems to make sense that they would heal on the set of a sitcom. It's full circle. -- Mayan, ahead of the first season, I asked if you and your father decided to make a pact that laid out some guidelines about working together. You said that you hadn't. George, looking back, do you think that was the right way to go? Do you wish you had laid out some terms? George: No, I know where the line is. But I remember, last year, we had a scene in the kitchen and Mayan says something like, ""Yeah, go ahead, for your daughter, the only one you have that we know of."" Then I said, in rehearsal, ""Is this real life? Or is this in the TV show?"" You could see her physical change. And I knew. But I'm very respectful of Mayan and how I speak to her and I leave her alone, I let her work, I don't go to her room or practice with her. I don't require that we say goodbye to each other at the end of the day if we're occupied with other things. We just leave. Professionally, that's the best way for it to work. -- Is there anything that surprised you, Mayan,about the process of working with your father? Mayan: Being raised by a stand-up [comedian] is a very unique upbringing, and you develop a thick skin pretty quickly. I think sometimes that could be pierced because of the material. But growing up, sometimes we would communicate through jokes. I think that translated to ""Lopez vs. Lopez"" because we're still bouncing off each other the way we'd always done through life. My poor mom -- sometimes my dad and I would just rag on her and just have these bits, but we would make each other laugh all the time of just going back and forth. That wasn't foreign. -- When you really sit and think about her and what you wish you could tell her, is it hard not to be emotional? George: I think so. ... I can see her and [hear] things that she would have said to me as a kid in the car seat and all that stuff and still see her in this frame, but I look at her and see different Mayans through all of her life. -- Debby, you're in a unique position in that the stars of your show are living the life that is on the screen. When you're around them, is it hard not totake notes as they're interacting? Debby: I'm taking notes all the time. Sometimes they will get into it, and it can be awkward and Mayan will be like, ""Write it down, Debby!"" I'm just so blessed that they're so open. I can't imagine making a show with my father. Their dynamic feels very familiar to me, the laughter and the dysfunction. It's something that I experienced in my own life; my mom's an immigrant from El Salvador [and] my dad's a Jew from Miami. I grew up with this family with completely different points of view. -- This season, things get meta when your characters begin working together. Why did you want to explore that and how much are you pulling from real life in the issues that arise? Debby: What we learned in the first season is the show really does live at home with the family. The vet [office] felt like a separate island. That's why we made that decision to have Mayan lose her job at the vet's office and work with George. We have a wealth of inspiration from the fact that they do work together to explore [and ask] what are those boundaries? Mayan: The specific storyline, with Mayan and George through the first season, it was them really repairing [their relationship], and they're still repairing, but you get to see the fruits of that labor in the storyline this season. I think that's what we're doing. I actually got to teach Mayan [the character] something. But it's nice to see Mayan and George are looking out for each other and also Mayan being very protective of her dad's sobriety, and caring for him and wanting him to be happy. -- George, you've been open about your relationship with alcohol. How did you feel about your character battling alcoholism in the show? Season 2 opens with your character being five weeks sober and still adjustingto it. George: I think that it is a definite good thing to talk about because it has been a thing that's been present in my life for a long, long time -- even though I don't drink as much as I did. Practically hardly anything. As difficult as I thought it would be [to have it in the show], I've actually enjoyed it. I'm an open book. Debby: With the sobriety storyline -- again, I'm growing and healing with this show. I started to confront my own issues with alcohol and overdoing it. I went for a long bout of sobriety last year, and our first episode back, when George is served a drink [at a restaurant] after five weeks sober, that actually happened to me. [In the scene, George orders a mocktail, but is served a drink with alcohol.] I had a breakdown because I was going through all the emotions of confronting how alcohol has been a bad presence in my life. But having George [the character] going through it, and getting sober, I really hope that inspires a lot of people, especially in our community, to confront it. We don't talk about it. -- The series is returning after theHollywood strikes. The industry has also been in the midst of contraction, and some of the casualties have beenLatino-centeredshows. Debby: If I thought about the tremendous amount of pressure it is to be ""one of the only"" or ""the only,"" it would cause me way too much anxiety. I can't control whether or not this show survives; all I can control is making the best show possible and putting all my energy and love into it and hope that it resonates with an audience, which it has been doing. We have this opportunity now and I'm focused on that: I'm training all the writers in the room to be showrunners. I take them with me through every step of the process, so that they can go out and pitch their Latino shows. We just need to get more. When we have the opportunity, it's important that we train the future. George: Look at how hard it is to have any show succeed; it's hard for everybody. But we [Latinos] get few opportunities. You see what [executives] prefer to use rather than looking like the world. You look at our show and it looks like what the world looks like. That's because of us. But also I know, because I've been in those rooms, they're not going to take a chance on a Latino lead. I remember Bob Iger said to me -- he asked me to go to some meeting at ABC; this dog and pony show -- and he says, ""George, how do we sell Hondas to Latinos?"" I said, ""You sell Hondas to everybody."" What do you want me to tell you? Make it La Honda? This is how you change things. You don't change things with ""I'm not going to buy that."" That doesn't work for us. You change it by creating, by not having an ax to grind. I don't have an ax to grind anymore. Debby: Culturally, we're told a lot, ""You can't. You're not good enough."" We have to change our mind-set. We can. We manifest it.

Products curated by The Informant are the best of the best: beautifully imagined and thoughtfully made products that become instantly indispensable. I love a chic bag as much as anyone. But living in New York - especially during the winter, where the weather is always a big question mark - I've long been on the hunt for a shoulder or crossbody bag that doesn't look out of place in everyday settings and that can withstand the elements, at least a little bit.  Enter the Uniqlo Round Mini Shoulder Bag.  Full disclosure: I'd seen this bag kicking around TikTok before I actually tried it, although I'm proud to say I rarely fall for buying a viral product solely because of its hype. But one day, I passed by the SoHo Uniqlo and decided to pop in to suss it out myself. It didn't take long for me to take a chance on it. Its crescent shape has a sleek, minimalist aesthetic; it comes in muted neutral shades that play well at the office, at brunch, at the gym, and more; its nylon exterior is both dirt-resistant and water-repellent. (According to the brand, the fabric has a water-repellent coating.) The best part? It was only $20 - a no-brainer, even if it had ended up being a bust. I chose the beige shade, grabbed a matching wool beanie (I'm a sucker for an impulse hat purchase), and called it a day. Since the morning I bought it on a whim, I've taken this bag nearly everywhere - or, to nearly all casual occasions - with me. Why? Not only can it actually withstand a downpour (I've carried it in the rain and its contents stayed utterly dry), but its capacity is perfect for my everyday needs. T bag is a bit of an optical illusion - it has a slim, structured profile but is much larger than it looks. I can fit my phone, a portable charger, a few makeup staples (mascara or lipstick), an Epi-Pen (peanut allergy here!), my Bose earbuds, and my wallet and still have room for more - all without it looking overstuffed or bulky. Bonus points for the two inner pockets, which are perfect for my keys or any jewelry, as well as for its slightly wrinkled finish, which doesn't show any dirt or wear.  It's the best $20 I've spent in a long time. I've had it for about three months and I use it almost every day; the price per wear is negligible at this point, and it will only decrease as I inevitably tend to use it pretty much daily. I'm all for a splurge, but when a basic is this good and this affordable? I say just do it.

Products curated by The Informant are the best of the best: beautifully imagined and thoughtfully made products that become instantly indispensable. Since I was a teenager, I've been drinking a gallon of water a day. In high school, when I was in choir and strained my vocal cords, I realized I had to take a beat, stop slugging the fountain Diet Coke from the gas station nearby, and put something in my body that actually made it feel better.  The habit stuck.  Today, I consider myself a bit of a water bottle connoisseur. I've used what feels like all the brands. First, in high school, it was a Gatorade bottle. College was my Contigo and CamelBak era. Post-graduation, I dipped my toe into Nalgenes (and still have one that is absolutely covered in stickers). I have a bright pink Starbucks cup in rotation, too, and will always drink from a mason jar if everything is in the wash.  Then I discovered the Owala FreeSip.  It happened when a friend of mine brought her Owala to a park hang. I'd seen this water bottle on TikTok, where Watertok had, for a moment, been a strange hydration trend.  The Owala's main selling point is its straw and locking mechanism. Other water bottles, like a Contigo or a CamelBak, have silicone spouts that are unfortunate breeding grounds for mildew; the Owala's spout is hard plastic, and large enough to wipe up or throw in the dishwasher and clean. The Owala's spout also has two openings: a small one that's the actual straw, and a large one for taking a longer drink. I have yet to spill mid-sip, and the bottle's insulation keeps it from sweating and leaving rings everywhere. Also, as an unexpected added benefit, the locking mechanism prevents my cat from tipping over my bottle, which he has done many times before, and spilling it. Could I have resolved all of the potential issues with other water bottles with coasters and more frequent cleanings? Yes. But does the Owala solve all of those problems and come in a bright pink colorway? Also yes. I'll choose it every time. Owala FreeSip Water Bottle (32oz.)

"February 16, 2024",The Liberal Media Bubble Is Thick on How to Cover Campaign 2024,232,"  Whenever you set up a liberal journalist or panel of liberal journalists to address ""the role of the media in the 2024 election,"" it's going to reflect the questions inside their bubble, so it's mostly about Donald Trump. How does he get away with so much? How does he gain advantage from 91 felony indictments? Can we cover his speeches live? Do we quote his social media posts? People on the Left don't believe in fairness or balance or giving both parties a chance to speak. They believe they are democracy and Republicans are the end of democracy. They will save the planet from climate catastrophe, and the Republicans are climate deniers. They are the ones who believe in diversity and inclusion but they won't include any Republicans, unless they provide that Liz Cheney echo of your biases. NPR media reporter David Folkenflik moderated a panel for something called the ""News Literacy Project,"" which clearly signaled they are aligned with the liberal media, since their guests on an Election 2024 panel were the alphabet of networks: ABC's Mary Bruce, CBS's Major Garrett, NBC's Kristen Welker and PBS's Geoff Bennett. Folkenflik shared one often-shared leftist theory from New York University professor Jay Rosen: Focus on ""the stakes, not the odds."" Don't cover the horse race and obsess over polls; warn people that reelecting Trump is an epic disaster. It's the argument we have witnessed for eight years now. ""Fair and balanced"" is like favoring ""dead and buried."" A journalist can't ""normalize"" Trump, can't let him speak live on camera. It's like allowing a deadly virus to infect democracy. That goes for Trump-friendly Republicans as well. Folkenflik asked Welker about leftists who were furious that she didn't push back on Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) when she described Jan. 6 prisoners as ""hostages."" Welker said she would probably act differently in retrospect, but she likes to let guests ""finish their thoughts."" That's not what she practiced in her Trump interview. Then Folkenflik ""balanced"" it by asking Garrett about George Stephanopoulos asking Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) if a president can defy Supreme Court rulings. Folkenflik mischaracterized the Vance answer, and Stephanopoulos cut Vance off, saying, ""You've made it very clear you believe the president can defy the Supreme Court."" Garrett sided with the Democrat hack: ""I'm not gonna flyspeck George Stephanopoulos here or anywhere else. George has earned his reputation as one of the best interlocutors in live television ... full stop."" Conservatives never have a point about being mistreated. Folkenflik briefly touched on pro-Trump voters and whether the ""mainstream"" media can educate them, but later Garrett was blunt: ""We can't service those who have decided to opt out. And if you watch Newsmax, you've opted out. You have said ... 'mainstream media, you don't meet my needs.'"" The NPR reporter pushed back, that maybe they'll get contrasting information from social media. Garrett dismissed it: ""If you're a dedicated Newsmax watcher, you're not going to be someone even inclined even if something comes in the side door of your feed, through Instagram or Facebook or X or TikTok, and it says 'CBS' on it, you have already decided, 'probably not.'"" What's fascinating is his lack of introspection, that he's saying, ""If something comes to me from Newsmax, I've already decided, 'probably not.'"" Liberals think the conservatives are the ones who can't process an opposing opinion and consider whether it's legitimate. We're automatically illegitimate, and argue in bad faith. Liberals organize unanimous panel discussions, in front of unanimous audiences who think conservatives would ""benefit"" from more liberal bias. The liberal bubble is real, and it's thick.

"March 11, 2024",THE NATION; GOP tries to link unrelated crimes to Biden policies; State of the Union response described trafficking in Mexico from 20 years ago.,233,"  The Republican senator who gave the party's response to President Biden's State of the Union address used a harrowing account of a young woman's sexual abuse to attack his border policies, but the rapes did not happen in the U.S. or during the Biden administration. First-term Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama in the GOP response criticized current immigration policies, describing how she had met a woman at the U.S.-Mexico border who told of being raped thousands of times in a sex trafficking operation run by cartels, starting at age 12. The victim has previously spoken publicly about the abuse happening in her home country of Mexico from 2004-08 -- not in the United States during the Biden administration. Yet, Britt used the account to chastise Biden's action on the border. ""We wouldn't be OK with this happening in a Third World country. This is the United States of America, and it's past time we start acting like it,"" Britt said in the Thursday night speech televised from her home in Alabama. ""President Biden's border crisis is a disgrace."" Britt has made immigration one of her top issues in her first years in the Senate, and Republicans have seized on a surge of immigrants entering the country during Biden's term to attack the president. Former President Trump, the front-runner for the Republican nomination this year, blames Biden for the killing of a Georgia nursing student after an immigrant from Venezuela who entered the U.S. illegally was arrested and charged with her murder. Independent journalist Jonathan Katz revealed in a TikTok video Friday that the sex trafficking of the victim mentioned by Britt on Thursday did not happen during the Biden administration or in the United States. Britt spokesman Sean Ross on Saturday confirmed to the Associated Press that the senator was speaking about the account of a young Mexican woman who told of being repeatedly raped in Mexico from 2004-08 -- when Republican George W. Bush was the U.S. president. Ross said people are still victims of ""disgusting, brutal trafficking by the cartels."" Britt traveled to the border at the Del Rio Sector in Texas in January 2023 with fellow Republican Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Cindy Hyde-Smith of Mississippi, according to a news release issued then from Hyde-Smith's office. ""The Senators held a roundtable with former Mexican Congresswoman Rosa Maria de la Garza, Fox News Contributor Sara Carter and Karla Jacinto Romero, a survivor of human trafficking,"" the news release said. ""The Senators learned about cartel activity in Mexico and the work being done to rescue victims of human trafficking."" Romero -- an advocate against human trafficking -- has spoken publicly about being a victim of child prostitution in Mexico, including during 2015 testimony to a subcommittee of the U.S. House. Romero, then 22, told the subcommittee that she was 12 when her mother threw her out on the streets, and a pimp trafficked her to more than 40,000 clients over four years. Romero said many of the clients were foreigners who had traveled to Mexico for sexual interactions with minors like her. Britt's rebuttal, delivered from her own kitchen table, laid out a dark vision for the country under Democrats and warned of violence. She talked about her two children and warned that ""life is getting more and more dangerous."" She also called Biden a ""dithering and diminished leader."" The Alabama senator, 42 and the youngest woman in the Senate, has said she wants to represent a new generation of leadership in Washington. She was endorsed by Trump in her 2022 election and has remained in touch with the former president, most recently pushing him to support in vitro fertilization after a ruling by her state's Supreme Court blocked some IVF procedures. -- AP reporters Mary Clare Jalonick and Adriana Gomez Licon contributed to this report.

"March 17, 2024",THE NATION; Pence says he's not endorsing Trump in 2024 race,234,"  Former Vice President Mike Pence says he will not be backing Donald Trump in the 2024 election. ""It should come as no surprise that I will not be endorsing Donald Trump this year,"" Pence said in an interview with Fox News on Friday, weighing in for the first time since the former president became the presumptive GOP nominee. Pence ran against Trump for their party's nomination but dropped his bid last year before voting began. The decision makes Pence the latest senior Trump administration official who has declined to endorse his former boss' bid to return to the White House. While Republican members of Congress and other GOP officials have largely rallied behind Trump, a vocal minority has continued to oppose his run. It also marks the end of a metamorphosis for Pence, who was one of Trump's most loyal defenders before and during his vice presidency but broke with his two-time running mate by refusing to go along with Trump's unconstitutional scheme to try to remain in power after losing the 2020 election. When Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, trying to disrupt the certification of Joe Biden's win, Pence was forced to flee to a Senate loading dock as rioters chanted, ""Hang Mike Pence!"" outside. In order to participate in the Republican primary debates, Pence was required to sign a pledge saying that he would support the party's eventual nominee. During the first debate, Pence was among the candidates who raised their hands when asked whether they would support Trump even if he were convicted in one of his four criminal indictments. But Pence had made clear he had come to harbor serious reservations about Trump. ""I believe anyone that puts themselves over the Constitution should never be president of the United States and anyone who asks someone else to put them over the Constitution should never be president of the United States again,"" he said during his campaign launch speech. As the campaign progressed, he raised alarms about the party's resistance to sending aid to Ukraine and called on his fellow Republicans to reject what he called the ""siren song of populism"" espoused by Trump and his followers. In the interview on Fox's ""The Story with Martha MacCallum,"" Pence said he was ""incredibly proud"" of his and Trump's record in office, but added, ""During my presidential campaign I made it clear that there were profound differences between me and President Trump on a range of issues, and not just our difference on my constitutional duties that I exercised on January the 6th. ""I mean, as I have watched his candidacy unfold, I've seen him walking away from our commitment to confronting the national debt. I've seen him starting to shy away from a commitment to the sanctity of human life,"" he said, referring to abortion, which Pence strongly opposes. Pence also mentioned what he called Trump's ""reversal on getting tough on China and supporting our administration's effort to force"" the sale of the popular TikTok app. ""In each of these cases, Donald Trump is pursuing and articulating an agenda that is at odds with the conservative agenda that we governed on during our four years. And that's why I cannot in conscience endorse Donald Trump in this campaign,"" he said. Pence declined to say whom he would be voting for but made clear it wouldn't be President Biden. ""I would never vote for Joe Biden,"" he said. ""I'm a Republican.""

Odd lighting and too-perfect details provide clues to the fact they were all generated using artificial intelligence. The photos, which have not been linked to the Trump campaign, emerged as Trump seeks to win over Black voters who polls show remain loyal to President Biden. The fabricated images, highlighted in a recent BBC investigation, provide further evidence to support warnings that the use of AI-generated imagery will only increase as the November general election approaches. Experts said they highlight the danger that any group -- Latinos, women, older male voters -- could be targeted with lifelike images meant to mislead and confuse as well as demonstrate the need for regulation around the technology. In a report published this week, researchers at the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate used several popular AI programs to show how easy it is to create realistic deepfakes that can fool voters. The researchers were able to generate fake images of Trump meeting with Russian operatives, Biden stuffing a ballot box and armed militia members at polling places, even though many of these AI programs say they have rules to prohibit this kind of content. The center analyzed some of the recent deepfakes of Trump and Black voters and determined that at least one was originally created as satire but was now being shared by Trump supporters as evidence of his support among Black voters. Social media platforms and AI companies must do more to protect users from AI's harmful effects, said Imran Ahmed, the center's CEO and founder. ""If a picture is worth a thousand words, then these dangerously susceptible image generators, coupled with the dismal content moderation efforts of mainstream social media, represent as powerful a tool for bad actors to mislead voters as we've ever seen,"" Ahmed said. ""This is a wake-up call for AI companies, social media platforms and lawmakers -- act now or put American democracy at risk."" The images prompted alarm on both the right and left that they could mislead people about the former president's support among Black people. Some in Trump's orbit have expressed frustration at the circulation of the fake images, believing that the manufactured scenes undermine Republican outreach to Black voters. ""If you see a photo of Trump with Black folks and you don't see it posted on an official campaign or surrogate page, it didn't happen,"" said Diante Johnson, president of the Black Conservative Federation. ""It's nonsensical to think that the Trump campaign would have to use AI to show his Black support."" Experts expect additional efforts to use AI-generated deepfakes to target specific voter blocs in key swing states, such as Latinos, women, Asian Americans and older conservatives, or any other demographic that a campaign hopes to attract, mislead or frighten. With dozens of countries holding elections this year, the challenges posed by deepfakes are a global issue. In January, voters in New Hampshire received a robocall that mimicked Biden's voice telling them, falsely, that if they cast a ballot in that state's primary they would be ineligible to vote in the general election. A political consultant later acknowledged creating the robocall, which may be the first known attempt to use AI to interfere with a U.S. election. Such content can have a corrosive effect even when it's not believed, according to a February study by researchers at Stanford University examining the potential impacts of AI on Black communities. When people realize they can't trust images they see online, they may start to discount legitimate sources of information. ""As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent and difficult to distinguish from human-generated content, individuals may become more skeptical and distrustful of the information they receive,"" the researchers wrote. Even if it doesn't succeed in fooling a large number of voters, AI-generated content about voting, candidates and elections can make it harder for anyone to distinguish fact from fiction, causing them to discount legitimate sources of information and lose trust, undermining faith in democracy while widening political polarization. While false claims about candidates and elections are nothing new, AI makes it faster, cheaper and easier than ever to craft lifelike images, video and audio. When released onto social media platforms like TikTok, Facebook or X, AI deepfakes can reach millions before tech companies, government officials or legitimate news outlets are even aware of their existence. ""AI simply accelerated and pressed fast forward on misinformation,"" said Joe Paul, a business executive and advocate who has worked to increase digital access among communities of color. Paul noted that Black communities often have ""this history of mistrust"" with major institutions, including in politics and media, that make Black communities more skeptical of public narratives about them and of fact-checking meant to inform the community. Digital literacy and critical thinking skills are one defense against AI-generated misinformation, Paul said. ""The goal is to empower folks to critically evaluate the information that they encounter online.""

"March 4, 2024",THE NATION; Russian claims aim to undercut Ukraine aid; Disinformation efforts use immigration as a wedge issue to weaken U.S. support for Kyiv.,236,"  For Vladimir Putin, victory in Ukraine may run through Texas' Rio Grande Valley. In recent weeks, Russian state media and online accounts tied to the Kremlin have spread and amplified misleading and incendiary content about U.S. immigration and border security. The campaign seems crafted to stoke outrage and polarization before the 2024 election for the White House, and experts who study Russian disinformation say Americans can expect more to come as the Russian president looks to weaken support for Ukraine and cut off a vital supply of aid. In social media posts, online videos and stories on websites, these accounts misstate the effect of immigration, highlight stories about crimes committed by immigrants, and warn of dire consequences if the U.S. doesn't crack down at its border with Mexico. Many are misleading, filled with cherry-picked data or debunked rumors. The pivot toward the U.S. comes after two years in which Russia's vast disinformation apparatus was busy pushing propaganda and disinformation about its invasion of Ukraine. Experts who study how authoritarian states use the internet to spread disinformation say that eroding support for Ukraine remains Russia's top priority -- and that the Kremlin is just finding new ways to do it. ""Things have shifted, even in the last few days,"" said Kyle Walter, head of research at Logically, a tech company that tracks disinformation campaigns. Experts and government officials have long warned of Russia's intentions. Walter said the content he's recently spotted shows Russia is ""going to focus on U.S. elections."" Logically identified dozens of pro-Russia accounts posting about immigration in the U.S., with a particular interest in promoting recent anti-immigration rallies in Texas. A recent Logically assessment concluded that after two years spent largely dedicated to the war in Ukraine, Russia's disinformation apparatus has ""started 2024 with a focus on the U.S."" Many posts highlight crimes allegedly committed by recent immigrants or suggest migrants are a burden on local communities. Some claims were posted by accounts with tiny audiences; others were made by state media sites with millions of followers. Last week the accounts seized on the recent death of a Georgia nursing student and the arrest of a Venezuelan man who had entered the U.S. illegally and was allowed to stay to pursue his immigration case. The killing quickly became a rallying cry for former President Trump and other Republicans who suggest that migrants commit crimes more often than do U.S. citizens. The evidence does not support those claims. The content, crafted in English, has quickly found its way to websites and platforms popular with American voters. Video of a recent anti-immigration protest broadcast by Russian outlet RT, for example, was racking up thousands of views on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, and prompting angry replies from other users. The Russian outlet Sputnik ran a story about growing calls to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall, a priority for Trump, who failed to complete the job as president. An analysis of other sites that later linked to the Sputnik piece shows than half were in the U.S., according to data from the online analytics firm Semrush.com. Overall, Americans make up the English-language Sputnik's largest audience. U.S. officials have warned that Russia could seek to meddle in the elections of dozens of countries in 2024, when more than 50 nations accounting for half of the world's population are scheduled to hold national votes. Although Russia has a strategic interest in the outcome of many of them -- the European Parliament, for one -- few offer the opportunity and the prize that the U.S. does. For Russia's bid to conquer Ukraine, this year's U.S. election stakes couldn't be higher. President Biden has pledged to fully back Ukraine. Republicans have been far less supportive. Trump has openly praised Putin and the former president has suggested he would encourage Russia to attack America's NATO allies if they don't pay their fair share for the military alliance. More than half of Republicans believe the U.S. is spending too much on Ukraine, according to a recent poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research that found Democrats to be much more supportive of additional aid. Soon after the war started, Russia mounted a disinformation campaign designed to cut into support for Ukraine. Claims included wild stories about secret U.S. germ warfare labs or Nazi conspiracies or that Ukrainian refugees were committing crimes and taking jobs from people who had welcomed them. That effort continues, but Russia also has shifted its attention to issues with no obvious tie to Moscow that are more likely to create cracks in the unity of its adversaries -- for example immigration or inflation, high-profile topics in the U.S. and Europe. ""They're very savvy and understand the right buttons to push,"" said Bret Schafer, senior fellow and head of the information manipulation team at the Alliance for Securing Democracy, a Washington-based nonprofit. ""If your ultimate objective is to reduce support for Ukraine, your inroad might be talking about how bad things are on the southern border. Their path to win this thing is to get the U.S. and the EU to stop sending weapons and aid to Ukraine."" A message left with the Russian Embassy in Washington wasn't immediately returned. The U.S. election may also be a tempting target for other authoritarian nations such as China and Iran that, like Russia, have shown a willingness to use online propaganda and disinformation to further their objectives. The online landscape has dramatically shifted since Russia sought to meddle in America's 2016 presidential race won by Trump. Platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have banned many Russian state accounts and built new safeguards aimed at preventing anyone from exploiting their sites. In one recent example, Meta, the owner of Facebook, announced in the fall that it had identified and stopped a network of thousands of fake accounts created in China in an apparent effort to fool American voters. Other platforms, including X, have taken a different approach, rolling back or even eliminating content moderation and rules designed to stop disinformation. Then there is TikTok, whose ties to China and popularity with young people have set off alarms in several state capitals and Washington. Artificial intelligence is another concern. The technology now makes it easier than ever to create audio or video that is lifelike enough to fool voters. Social media are no longer the only battleground either. Increasingly, Russia and other disinformation spreaders use encrypted messaging sites or websites that masquerade as legitimate news outlets. ""A lot of their activity has moved off the major platforms to places were they can operate more freely,"" said John Hultquist, chief analyst at Mandiant Intelligence, a cybersecurity firm monitoring Russian disinformation. Walter, Logically's research director, said he is most concerned about disinformaton on X and TikTok this year, given their lack of controls and their popularity, especially with young voters. He said that while election years tend to highlight the dangers of disinformation, the most effective information operations are launched years in advance. America's adversaries have spent a long time studying its politics, building online networks and cultivating domestic divisions. Now comes the payoff. ""They don't need to put a ton of effort into causing disinformation,"" Walter said. ""They've already laid the groundwork leading up to 2024.""

"February 1, 2024","THE NATION; Social media CEOs grilled on risk to children; The leaders of Meta, TikTok, X and other companies testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.",237,"  Sexual predators. Addictive features. Suicide and eating disorders. Unrealistic beauty standards. Bullying. These are just some of the issues young people are dealing with on social media -- and children's advocates and lawmakers say companies are not doing enough to protect them. On Wednesday, the chief executives of Meta, TikTok, X and other social media companies went before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify as lawmakers and parents grow increasingly concerned about the effects of social media on young people's lives. The hearing began with recorded testimony from kids and parents who said they or their children were exploited on social media. Throughout the hours-long event, parents who lost children to suicide silently held up pictures of their dead kids. ""They're responsible for many of the dangers our children face online,"" Senate Assistant Majority Leader Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), who chairs the committee, said in opening remarks. ""Their design choices, their failures to adequately invest in trust and safety, their constant pursuit of engagement and profit over basic safety have all put our kids and grandkids at risk."" In a heated question-and-answer session with Mark Zuckerberg, Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley asked the Meta CEO whether he has personally compensated any of the victims and their families for what they have been through. ""I don't think so,"" Zuckerberg replied. ""There's families of victims here,"" Hawley said. ""Would you like to apologize to them?"" Parents attending the hearing rose and held up pictures of their children. Zuckerberg stood as well, turning away from his microphone and the senators to address them directly. ""I'm sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should go through the things that your families have suffered,"" he said, adding that Meta continues to invest and work on ""industrywide efforts"" to protect children. But children's advocates and parents have repeatedly emphasized that none of the companies are doing enough. ""Meta's general approach is 'trust us, we'll do the right thing,' but how can we trust Meta? The way they talk about these issues feels like they are trying to gaslight the world,"" said Arturo Bejar, a former engineering director at the social media giant. He recently testified before Congress about child safety on Meta's platforms. ""Every parent I've met with a kid under 13 is afraid of when their kid is old enough to be in social media."" Hawley continued to press Zuckerberg, asking whether he'd take personal responsibility for the harms his company has caused. Zuckerberg stayed on message and repeated that Meta's job is to ""build industry-leading tools"" and empower parents. ""To make money,"" Hawley cut in. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C), the top Republican on the Judiciary panel, echoed Durbin's sentiments and said he's prepared to work with Democrats to solve the issue. ""After years of working on this issue with you and others, I've come to conclude the following: Social media companies as they're currently designed and operate are dangerous products,"" Graham said. He told the executives their platforms have enriched lives but that it is time to deal with ""the dark side."" Beginning with Discord's Jason Citron, the executives touted existing safety tools on their platforms and the work they've done with nonprofits and law enforcement to protect minors. Snapchat had broken ranks ahead of the hearing and begun backing a federal bill that would create a legal liability for apps and social platforms that recommend harmful content to minors. Snap CEO Evan Spiegel reiterated the company's support Wednesday and asked the industry to back the bill. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said TikTok is vigilant about enforcing its policy barring children under 13 from using the app. CEO Linda Yaccarino said X, formerly Twitter, doesn't cater to children. ""We do not have a line of business dedicated to children,"" Yaccarino said. She said X will also support the Stop CSAM Act, a federal bill that make it easier for victims of child exploitation to sue tech companies. Yet child health advocates say social media companies have failed repeatedly to protect minors. ""When you're faced with really important safety and privacy decisions, the revenue in the bottom line should not be the first factor that these companies are considering,"" said Zamaan Qureshi, co-chair of Design It For Us, a youth-led coalition advocating for safer social media. ""These companies have had opportunities to do this before they failed to do that. So independent regulation needs to step in."" Republican and Democratic senators came together in a rare show of agreement throughout the hearing, though it's not yet clear whether this will be enough to pass legislation such as the Kids Online Safety Act, proposed in 2022 by Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Republican Sen. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee. Meta is being sued by dozens of states that say it deliberately designs features on Instagram and Facebook that addict children to its platforms and has failed to protect them from online predators. New internal emails among Meta executives released by Blumenthal's office show Nick Clegg, president of global affairs, and others asking Zuckerberg to hire more people to strengthen ""wellbeing across the company"" as concerns grew about effects on youth mental health. ""From a policy perspective, this work has become increasingly urgent over recent months. Politicians in the U.S., U.K., E.U. and Australia are publicly and privately expressing concerns about the impact of our products on young people's mental health,"" Clegg wrote in an August 2021 email. The emails released by Blumenthal's office don't appear to include a response, if there was any, from Zuckerberg. In September 2021, the Wall Street Journal released the Facebook Files, its report based on internal documents from whistleblower Frances Haugen, who later testified before the Senate. Meta has beefed up its child safety features in recent weeks, announcing last month that it will start hiding inappropriate content from teenagers' accounts on Instagram and Facebook, including posts about suicide, self-harm and eating disorders. It also restricted minors' ability to receive messages from anyone they don't follow or aren't connected to on Instagram and Messenger and added new ""nudges"" to try to discourage teens from browsing Instagram videos or messages late at night. The nudges encourage kids to close the app, though it does not force them to do so. Google's YouTube is notably missing from the list of companies called to the Senate hearing Wednesday even though more kids use YouTube than any other platform, according to the Pew Research Center. Pew found that 93% of U.S. teens use YouTube, with TikTok a distant second at 63%.

"December 21, 2023",The shopping app that puts a price tag on all your friendships,239,"  Want to know how much your friends are worth? Meet Flip, the shopping app that will put a price tag on every single person in your phone's contact list. Cajole one of them into signing up for the app, and you get cash - up to $130 per person - to spend on Flip. ""The crazy thing is people are worth different amounts of money if you successfully get them on the app,"" said Lily Goldfarb, 27, a Flip user from Silver Lake. ""I had one friend who was only worth, like, $25. It was really so sad."" In some circles, this referral challenge has created a frenzied bounty hunt for one's most valuable friends. And it has earned Flip a moment of buzz, a valuable currency in the competitive landscape of social shopping. Some estimates put the app's total downloads at around 2 million.  El Segundo-based Flip, which sells an array of products from hip direct-to-consumer brands to snack foods, is pitching itself as a rare marketplace where customers can trust product reviews, and it's willing to pay big bucks in user acquisition costs to get this vision up and running.  The referral game is only one way the app compensates users. Flip, which officially launched some six months ago, will pay you for commenting on video product reviews and even just passively swiping through the app's TikTok-style feed of seemingly endless content. If you review a product, you get a cut of the app's ad revenue - no matter if the review is positive or negative. Is Flip offering something that's too good to last? Probably. Enabling consumerism on a whole new scale? Likely. And yet - it might be better than the status quo. At the very least, Flip is aiming to respond to the ills of today's online shopping landscape: fake reviews, discrepancies between product photos and what arrives on your doorstep, and influencers endorsing mediocre products with unwarranted enthusiasm. The company is promising another way to shop, one where the consumer should feel like the winner. The bounty hunt It's easy to be swept up in the cash grab of Flip's referral game. Each user's potential earnings are shown in a thermometer-style graphic on the app: names of your phone contacts are shown next to their ""worth,"" and the total value of your possible winnings is front and center. For many users, this number is tens of thousands of dollars. Goldfarb, who works at a nonprofit, was initially wary when a friend sent her a $75 referral coupon to join Flip, but it was hard to say no to, as she called it, ""free money."" Upon seeing the $75 in her account, the former skeptic was transformed. Goldfarb quickly became one of the most avid Flip users among her friends. In November, she earned nearly $850 from referring 14 people to the app, including her mom. She spent the cash on skin care, hair products and kitchen supplies. Flip's founder keeps close to the vest how the company determines the value of your friends, but many have noticed that Flip syncs with a user's phone contacts, and those with more friends already on Flip command higher referral bonuses. Lena Renshaw, 25, a software engineer and business school student who lives in Brooklyn, has earned close to $1,000 in referral bounties. The most she earned from one referral was $100. ""It was definitely my most popular, cool friend,"" she said. But the most valuable contact Renshaw saw was a surprising one: her driver's ed teacher from high school. ""She had all of these students' numbers saved throughout the history of time, which I thought was funny,"" Renshaw said. She used her winnings to outfit her kitchen with products from Flip - plates, cups, silverware, a lemon squeezer and Tupperware. She also bought books and a projector that makes her room look like a planetarium. Come for the cash, stay for the anti-influencer reviews ""The whole concept of Flip is, how do we build honesty around commerce?"" said Noor Agha, the app's co-founder. For starters, the company eliminated five-star product rankings, which are increasingly easy to fake on the internet. Instead, users flick through review videos before adding an item to their cart, using the same addictive thumb scroll as TikTok and Instagram Reels.  Unlike TikTok and Reels, product reviews on Flip are mostly made by everyday people, not professional influencers being paid thousands. Brands are banned from sponsoring video reviews. And everyone engaging in the process - from creators to viewers to commenters - can make a few bucks along the way. ""Who do you trust more: Flip or the brand? Or the person that bought it before you?"" Agha said. Flip assumes that when you incentivize everyone to give the pros and cons in their own product testimonials in exchange for a little cash, you'll get an honest space online. ""If everything is positive,"" Agha said, ""it means everything is a lie."" The company is betting this value proposition will set it apart from rivals, like TikTok Shop, which already has a built-in audience; TikTok has 150 million U.S. users, and teens spend an average of nearly two hours a day using the app. TikTok Shop is teeming with product-pitching influencers, many of whom have discovered they can earn enough commissions to make reviews a serious side gig. Flip reviewers automatically earn money, with the amount varying based on the engagement a video gets. Brands cannot pay creators to make content, and the app pays all creators the same rates, regardless of follower count. These earnings are a cut of Flip's advertising revenue, although the company is not yet profitable. (""It's still early days,"" Agha said, adding that Flip has roughly 150 advertisers so far.) ""I saw a lot of people making video reviews for products they had gotten being like, 'this is terrible,'"" Renshaw said. ""I thought that was unique about the app and something that you wouldn't find on Instagram."" This is a new phase in the influencer ecosystem, said Blake Michael, a partner at CreatorLed Ventures, a venture firm for influencers. The first phase was the original mommy bloggers - genuine people who accidentally blew up online. The second phase was professional creators - those who set out to make a living shilling products. ""I think today we're seeing the third step. ... People are a little bit more skeptical to trust these people who are just famous for being famous, and they would much rather just hear from a real, normal person,"" he said. Earnings for creators on Flip can vary. One user posted a video review that attracted about 5,000 unique views and seven comments, earning her $31 in three days. Another earned far less - $13 in a month from three video reviews that attracted almost 4,000 cumulative views. Agha claims some super users earn between $5,000 and $10,000 a month. That cash either can be applied to in-app purchases or directly deposited into one's bank account. Users can also accrue small amounts for watching, liking and commenting on videos, a few cents per action. That revenue can only be credited to in-app orders. The real question is whether all of this cash really does buy legitimacy for a new marketplace up against sizable competitors. Not everyone is sold.  ""It was really hard to gain people's trust with it,"" said Uma Bates, 28, a copywriter and fiction writer who lives in New York. ""I think that convincing them that [the app] was legitimate and that their information wasn't going to be stolen was an incredibly hard thing to do, and I can't say that I convinced many people to use it, just a few here and there."" Fuzzy economics, big competition Flip is funding this endeavor so far with $95 million in venture capital backing. The company closed a $60-million Series B funding round last summer led by WestCap, according to a company press release. Mubadala Capital and Streamlined Ventures also participated in the funding round. Flip said it is currently focused on expanding its product offerings. ""I promise you between now and the next three months, you will start seeing everything,"" Agha said. ""And by June, there shouldn't be anything that you want to buy that you can't find on Flip."" The task is made easier by the company's main distribution model: dropshipping. Brands handle their own shipping, and Flip handles the less capital-intensive business of customer service and returns. (The company will manage some brands' shipping for an extra fee, but fewer than 5% have chosen that option.)  Even though Flip seems flush with cash, the start-up's costly user acquisition strategy - and gamified sign-up process - is worrying some in the VC space.  ""I just don't know how long that's going to last, especially if their product market fit revolves around people basically getting paid to use the app,"" Michael said. Larger rivals TikTok Shop, Amazon Inspire and Instagram Reels all have a massive head start in the social shopping space. Michael also wonders how many users will be willing to transition away from using their referral bounties to using their own money.  Agha dismisses the skepticism. ""Our job is to add the products, deliver the best e-commerce service, and people [will] talk to each other,"" Agha said. ""Whether it's positive or negative, you get paid."" Uncertainty about its future aside, this much is true: Flip is offering something hard to come by these days in the noisy and often dystopian world of social media - fun.  ""I noticed that whenever I would invite somebody who had a much higher bounty, I would not be the first to be texting them,"" Michael said. ""[They'd] be like, 'Blake, 20 other people have texted me about this,'"" he said. The bounty hunt continues. This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"February 8, 2024",The subversive power of the 'cool aunties',240,"  In the great taxonomy of aunts in popular culture, there are stern aunts, maternal aunts and cruel aunts (like malevolent Aunt Petunia in the ""Harry Potter"" tales). But these days one particular category of aunt appears to be on the rise: the cool aunt. You've probably encountered some version of the cool aunt online or IRL. She is also known as the rich auntie, the eccentric aunt, the savvy aunt, the sexy aunt, the wild aunt or the PANK, a.k.a. Professional Aunt No Kids (because capitalism will turn any phenomenon into a market segment). The cool aunt often carries herself with an air of glamour and authority -- Edna Mode of ""The Incredibles"" has strong cool aunt energy. She's also a bit of a rule breaker. It's the cool aunt who will take you to a dirty ballet at 14 and let you have your first sip of Champagne. These days, cool aunts seem to be popping up everywhere -- and the timing is likely no coincidence. At a moment in which women's bodily autonomy is being constricted by a slew of anti-abortion laws, the cool aunt offers a model of self-assured sexual independence. The cool aunt also provides a critical alternative to the limitations of the nuclear family. For queer teens, a cool aunt can be a source of emotional and material support. ""Aunts offer alternatives,"" says Patty Sotirin, author of the 2013 book ""Where the Aunts Are: Family, Feminism and Kinship in Popular Culture."" ""They offer different ways of connecting us and give us a sense of other possibilities. These days, they are so important."" In December, comedian Ego Nwodim appeared on ""Saturday Night Live's"" ""Weekend Update"" as a character called Rich Auntie With No Kids, armed with a martini, a fur stole and a dismissive attitude toward maternity. A few weeks later, Universal Television announced that the ""Rutherford Falls"" creative team of Sierra Teller Ornelas and Jana Schmieding was developing a comedy series called ""Bonnie"" about a cool aunt who returns to the reservation to help raise her brother's children. My social media feeds as of late have been awash in cool aunt memes -- both in English and Spanish. On Instagram, there are nearly 182,000 posts tagged #richauntyvibes, featuring women looking fashionable as they lead their best life, while on TikTok, hashtags like #coolaunt and #cooltia turn up thousands of videos with millions of collective views. Among my favorites is one of a series of posts by Fernando Pacheco, an architecture student from Venezuela who goes by the handle @fertris.7, that shows him posing as a glamorous tia cool -- complete with large handbag and even larger sunglasses. The aunt he portrays is a woman ""who is modern, who is always going to be fashionable,"" he tells me. She is ""a personality who is down for anything."" But the cool aunt is much more than her trappings. She is a woman who defies the limitations of gender proscribed on women -- and therein lies the appeal. ""With the mother, you have all of these cultural expectations,"" says author Sotirin. Mothers are expected to be wholesome and nurturing. ""But not the aunt. You don't have the same thing with the aunt."" The archetype of the cool aunt is hardly new. In the 1958 comedy ""Auntie Mame,"" for example, Rosalind Russell played a delirious bohemian who assumes the care of her 10-year-old nephew after the sudden death of his father. (Among other things, she schools him in the art of making a martini ""because knowledge is power."") In more recent years, the cool aunt has been transformed into an economic niche as marketers have set their sights on the disposable income wielded by an increasing number of childless women. Lifestyle sites such as Rich Auntie Supreme peddle auntie-themed merch while a variety of auntie-themed podcasts offer everything from relationship to financial advice. But what makes the cool aunt such a meaningful figure right now is that her increasing prominence lands at a time in which women are losing hard-fought gains. Last year, the Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade, which has resulted in severe restrictions to a woman's right to abortion in almost two dozen states. Last month, a study published by the Journal of the American Medical Assn. estimated that there were more than 26,000 rape-related pregnancies in Texas in the 16-month period since restrictions went into effect, essentially turning women into birthing vessels against their will. (Texas offers no exceptions for rape or incest.) Recently, a woman in Ohio faced potential criminal charges for how she handled a home miscarriage. (Thankfully, the grand jury deciding her case declined to indict her last month.) Meanwhile, an ascendant right wing is busy flogging the concept of the nuclear family -- heterosexual, natch -- with men as breadwinners and women maintaining the home and raising children. Prominent on social media these days are ""tradwives"" (slang for ""traditional wives""), who take to TikTok in flowery dresses to extol the virtues of home-cooked meals and submitting to their husbands. What two consenting adults do in the privacy of their home is nobody's business but theirs. (Though the highly aestheticized frontier look can be unsettling if your ancestors happened to be on the receiving end of Manifest Destiny.) But, as the feminists say, the personal is political. And tradwives are often used by right-wing media to drive a wedge between groups of women, pitting feminists against homemakers in the culture wars. The phenomenon also fetishizes ""traditional"" gender roles, creating a hard binary between men and women, between who occupies the public sphere and who does the child-rearing. Never mind that, as English demographer and anthropologist Rebecca Sear has written, family bonds and the raising of children across societies are generally not confined to an isolated family unit, but instead depend on a complex web of relationships in and out of the family. The figure of the cool aunt cheekily subverts the controls imposed on women -- which is probably why she is currently a darling on social media. ""When you have this pullback and restriction,"" says Sotirin, ""you have to have something -- other possibilities, other ways to empower ourselves. ... The auntie is the perfect model for that."" Moreover, within family structures, cool aunts serve a function that goes beyond simply being a sassy role model. ""Where do you learn about sex?"" Sotirin asks. ""If you have a question and it's too embarrassing to ask your parents, you ask the cool aunt."" It's a phenomenon that is drawing the attention of scientists. A longitudinal study published December in the sociology journal Socius, which followed 83 LGBTQ+ youth in California and Texas over two years, reported that ""aunts (including heterosexual aunts) can challenge cisheteronormativity, can serve as an important social support network for youth and can serve as housing support for young people."" Sotirin says this is something she has seen in her own research on ""aunting."" Queer youth, she says, might find acceptance with a cool aunt that they don't get from their parents. ""I interviewed a student who is gay and belonged to a religious community, but he talked to his aunt and, through his childhood, she supported him."" Pop culture has turned the cool aunt into a cartoon character: a wearer of large sunglasses and bearer of designer handbags. Like so much in our culture, it's the acquisitiveness that gets highlighted. But cool aunts are much more than their accessories. (I say this as a cool aunt who doesn't own a single designer anything but will take you to a dirty ballet.) Cool aunts may be glamorous. But, more importantly, they are subversive -- a powerful statement of noncompliance to chauvinist systems of control.

In our never-ending quest for shoes that hit the sweet spot between cuteness and all-day comfort, we've come across our fair share of worthy candidates, from Brooks running shoes to Vionic sandals. But only one shoe has lived up to the hype so well it's actually known as 'the perfect travel shoe.' It all started when TikToker Meghan Pruittwent viral after wearing her Dr. Scholl's Time Off Sneakers every single day on a trip across 12 countries and was ""walking a ton"" with barely any foot pain at all.  You'd think that due to their TikTok fame - the white platform sneakers went viral last year across Instagram and YouTube too - they'd be sold out everywhere, but right now Dr. Scholl's Time Off Sneakers are in stock in plenty of colors and sizes on Amazon. Oh, and they're 30 percent off. No wonder they're Amazon's number-one best-selling fashion sneakers for women.  Dr. Scholl's Time Off Sneaker  $70$10030% off Buy Now Ladies and gentlemen (well, technically these shoes are just for ladies), behold the Dr. Scholl's Time Off Sneaker, which has pretty much been viral for more than a year in Smooth White (seen here) thanks to its various comfort features - like a 1 1/2-inch platform, an anatomically cushioned insole and built-in stretch - as well as its trendy, go-with-anything look. The TikTok creator who kicked off these viral sensations wore them with every single outfit, after all.  Another TikTok userwho has wide feet says they were ""shocked, completely shocked"" at how well the Time Off Sneaker fit. ""The shoe was very comfortable, the toe box was very wide...nothing was rubbing or hurting,"" she said after purchasing the shoes for the 2024 travel season. ""In the arch area...it was wide enough where I didn't feel like my foot was going over the insole.""  @meghan.pruitt best travel shoes ever ? #travelshoes #walkingshoes #casualsneakers #europeshoes #shoesforeurope #shoesfortravel #greenscreen #drscholls original sound - meghan?pruitt ""Walked thousands of miles in Europe and in Texas, and they're still holding up as new,"" another TikToker declared. 'Yes they get a little dirty but they're worth every penny."" Here's one of our favorite reviews from an Amazon shopper who loves to travel. ""I am the one on any trip with a foot or shoe issue...I've never found a shoe that can handle what I put it through without blisters and moleskin. After reading many of these reviews, I literally bought these the night before I left and wore them out of the box to the airport. They were the only shoes I wore our entire trip in Europe. After 120,000+ steps in 6 days of varied weather and no break in time, it would be challenging to find any shoes that deserve this quick of a 5 star rating. In addition to the stellar functionality, they stayed white, easy to clean, and are true to size. Thank you to the reviewers before me as these took a typical negative trip issue completely off the table."" Dr. Scholl's Time Off Sneaker - Off White Floral $70$10030% off Buy Now Plenty of reviewers are comparing these Dr. Scholl's sneakers to Hokas, which are pretty much synonymous with comfort. But this reviewer took it to the next level. ""I was hesitant about ordering these shoes thinking there was no way they were as comfortable as the TikTok girls were saying but HOLY COW!!! They are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn, even more comfortable than my Hokas,"" they wrote. And there's more good news: if white sneakers aren't totally your jam, the Dr. Scholl's Time Off Platform Sneakers come in colors too, and Amazon has some hues (but not all) like Red Canvas and Toasted Taupe Microfiber in stock and on sale, too. These are also great options if you prefer fabric sneakers over (faux) leather. Dr. Scholl's has been on a roll lately, recently dropping an updated version of its iconic clog in collaboration with Free People.

"April 10, 2024",The U.S. might ban TikTok. Record labels are cutting ties. What's music's Plan B?,245,"  In November 2022, Isimeme Udu uploaded the song that changed her life. The singer, who performs as Hemlocke Springs, was stressing about her medical studies at Dartmouth when she dropped her synth-pop track ""Girlfriend"" onto TikTok. Its lo-fi élan immediately found an audience. Within hours, Grimes commented with high praise, and fans clamored for the new ""awkward Black girl anthem,"" as many described it. Millions of plays later, Udu finished her degree and became a touring sensation - she opened for Muna at the Greek Theatre and, this summer, will open Doja Cat's European arena tour. ""When it came to music, I thought it was just unattainable,"" Udu said. ""People talk about getting a foot in the door, but I didn't even know what the door was. Days later, people were stopping me on campus asking 'Are you Hemlocke?'"" Udu is grateful for the opportunity the app offered. ""I've been so lucky to meet so many cool people who I never thought would know me,"" she said. ""But that can't be at the expense of doing the thing that made you popular. I had a viral moment, but I had to say, 'Don't lose yourself, because that's only going to be temporary.'"" She was right. TikTok's status as music's hitmaking force suddenly looks less certain. In February, Universal Music Group, the largest record label conglomerate in the world, pulled its catalog from TikTok. Videos using music from Taylor Swift or Bad Bunny suddenly fell silent. After a contentious U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing about ByteDance, the app's Chinese parent firm, and its potential risks for data security and political influence, the House overwhelmingly passed a bill in March that could force a sale or ban TikTok (President Biden has said he's open to signing that bill). The Senate has held closed-door meeting on the topic, and TikTok urged its users to contact Congress to protest. Representatives for TikTok declined to make executives available for an interview. But given the existential threats to the app, musicians are wondering whether they need a Plan B. ""I didn't start out with connections, and that moment opened up everything for me,"" Udu said. ""But music is why I'm here. I'm not a TikTok personality."" TikTok began life as Musical.ly, an app to film oneself lip-syncing to songs. Interacting with pop music was a core function of TikTok. Fans and artists shared music they loved, grafting it onto videos showing their lives and ideas. It was a lifeline to friends and culture during the pandemic. Though the app is now a source of infinite types of content made by a billion users, countless songs - from Fleetwood Mac's ""Dreams"" to Kylie Minogue's ""Padam Padam"" - found new life there. In a new report, TikTok said that 56% of users began listening to a new musician or podcast after watching a TikTok video.  But TikTok's benefits to the music industry were primarily in exposure, not money. Despite earning around $18 billion annually in ad revenue (in large part through videos that use licensed music), one study estimated that TikTok only pays out $400 million annually to all music rights holders. Unlike Spotify, which pays fixed royalty rates per stream, TikTok pays a flat fee to labels as a kind of blanket license. UMG's dispute with TikTok upended that agreement. In a January open letter announcing the threat of a pullout, UMG said that ""TikTok proposed paying our artists and songwriters at a rate that is a fraction of the rate that similarly situated major social platforms pay ...Ultimately TikTok is trying to build a music-based business, without paying fair value for the music. TikTok's tactics are obvious: use its platform power to hurt vulnerable artists and try to intimidate us into conceding to a bad deal that undervalues music and shortchanges artists and songwriters as well as their fans."" In a statement to The Times, TikTok said that ""It is sad and disappointing that Universal Music Group has put their own greed above the interests of their artists and songwriters. Despite Universal's false narrative and rhetoric, the fact is they have chosen to walk away from the powerful support of a platform with well over a billion users that serves as a free promotional and discovery vehicle for their talent. TikTok has been able to reach 'artist-first' agreements with every other label and publisher."" In February, UMG followed through and pulled its enormous catalog - which included songs by Universal Music Publishing Group songwriters in addition to UMG recording artists - from TikTok. The ferocity of UMG's actions surprised even major-label veterans. ""It was such a ballsy move,"" said Sarah Flanagan, a former senior director of digital marketing at Columbia Records (which is not part of UMG). ""TikTok hasn't figured out a way to compensate artists or labels fairly for the amount of music that gets used. As great it's been for music discovery, I hope this works, because TikTok's system for compensating artists is either not good enough or they don't care enough."" Eugene Lee, the founder of ChannelMeter, a firm that handles payments to musicians and content creators across social platforms, said that TikTok could change the way it compensates musicians, but has little incentive to now. ""YouTube distributes an enormous chunk of its revenue to music rights. TikTok hasn't prioritized that, so you have to ask, what are they prioritizing?"" Lee said. (In 2022, YouTube paid about $6 billion to music rights holders). ""Maybe they don't want to be so dependent on music as an economic factor of their platform. Rights are a complex problem, but every year they say, 'Oh, we'll come to a fairer model next year,' and labels just got fed up."" Yet UMG's sudden about-face, after years of accepting these terms, surprised other tech industry-watchers. ""ByteDance built this multibillion dollar company off of content including music. If UMG had said years ago that 'you can't do this,' I'd say sure, you're pissed because a company is growing off your music,"" said Ed Zitron, a tech marketing executive and host of the insightfully skeptical podcast ""Better Offline."" ""But this just feels like rich people smacking each other in the face. Music needs TikTok more than TikTok needs UMG. TikTok has the leverage, and the only people suffering are musicians and customers."" No one disputes TikTok's importance for reaching younger audiences today. But insiders say the app's well of instant virality could be drying up. ""The difference in 2024 is that there's no clear cheat code to work TikTok's algorithm anymore,"" said Chris Berdine, an L.A.-based creative director who has worked on marketing campaigns for acts including Juice Wrld, Peso Pluma and the Chainsmokers. ""We know that this platform is extremely important, but no matter what you try to do to hack it now, it's never consistent. Influencers don't carry the same weight as they once did."" Some artists genuinely enjoy the creative tools of TikTok, and Berdine's sympathetic to young artists' conundrums around it. ""This mandate to constantly churn out content for TikTok - are any of these timeless artists of the past that we admire participating in this? Absolutely not,"" Berdine said. ""But then you have younger artists that are like, 'Of course that's what you need to do'."" Imogene Strauss is a creative director working on the rollout for Charli XCX's album ""Brat."" She'd be remiss not to prioritize videos on the digital platform where Charli's fans gather. ""TikTok is is a huge and useful platform for most artists - it works really well for Charli,"" Strauss said. ""We're in the middle of a big album campaign now, it would be devastating for our plan if a ban or licensing dispute happened."" Charli XCX is on Atlantic, so the UMG pullout didn't affect her. But the demands of cultivating an audience on TikTok take a toll too. Charli XCX recently posted a listof cringey marketing ideas for going viral on TikTok that she claims were sent to her team, like ""Charli gets her nipples pierced at Claire's"" and ""Charli gets caught shoplifting at a mall and leaks the CCTV footage."" ""TikTok stresses all artists out,"" Strauss said. ""It's a constant and ruling platform that you have to feed now in addition to all the other other platforms. The amount of content that artists are expected to make would make your mind explode. She has lot of self-awareness about that, and with that post, she's trying to not hide those pressures."" For younger acts who have recently found viral fame there, their relationship to TikTok is as complicated as any romance they write songs about. In 2022, the singer-songwriter Maddie Zahm released the single ""Fat Funny Friend""on TikTok. The song is a painful lament for how she used feel about her body and relationships, and it was an instant smash there. ""When I posted it, my publisher called me and said, 'Go check TikTok,' and I saw so many people going through the same things,"" Zahm said. The song's earned nearly 30,000 fan video creations, and Zahm has 1.2 million followers there. In March, she played a packed El Rey Theatre show. ""TikTok directed my music to who it needed to go to,"" Zahm said. ""That song helped me heal and it resonated. That's the most fulfilling part of being a musician."" Yet she admits she's limiting her time there. ""Vulnerability isn't something I can do all the time,"" Zahm said. ""I have to take breaks because I'm still growing a lot as a person, and those rushes of want for connection will come, but I never want to force it based on views or likes.""  Singer Zoë Hoetzel, who performs as Zolita, built a sizable following (500,000 followers) for her pithy quips on queer culture, alongside operatic videos for singles like ""Bloodstream"" and ""Bedspell."" She's grateful for TikTok's ability to let her music videos reach ""queer 14-year-olds in Kansas, that's so exciting to me,"" she said. ""But it is weird to be like 'I wrote this powerful, vulnerable thing, and now I have to package it and perform emotion by sitting in my car and crying so that people will see me and listen,'"" Zolita admitted. ""It's really interesting what you've got to do to get people to pay attention there. It's hard to keep your sanity when it's such a numbers game, and to be at the mercy of this platform when you're promoting art."" So what would happen if no one is at TikTok's mercy anymore?  A government ban, or a dug-in conflict between the app, labels and publishing companies, would upend assumptions about how to grow an audience. Such a day may be coming sooner than many expected. ""My reaction to this briefing is that TikTok is a gun aimed at Americans' heads,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., told reporters after a classified Senate briefing on TikTok. ""The Chinese communists are weaponizing information, but they are constantly, surreptitiously collecting from 170 million Americans and potentially aiming that information, using it through algorithms, at the core of American democracy."" Shou Zi Chew, ByteDance's CEO, said in recent congressional testimony that ""I understand that there are concerns stemming from the inaccurate belief that TikTok's corporate structure makes it beholden to the Chinese government or that it shares information about U.S. users with the Chinese government. This is emphatically untrue...Let me state this unequivocally: ByteDance is not an agent of China or any other country."" For musicians and industry insiders, whose careers now depend on TikTok, they aren't sure who to root for. ""Artists want their music on TikTok,"" Strauss said. ""It's good promotion, and it sucks for those that aren't there anymore. But artists should also be getting paid, and yet I'm not sure it would change that many things for artists themselves. I'm not saying TikTok is fundamentally good, but the only people suffering here are the artists."" Zahm agrees. ""It's kind of heartbreaking, I'm friends with people that have worked really hard to write songs, and given that TikTok kind of runs the music industry, it sucks to tell them they're not allowed to be on it,"" she said. ""I expected there to be a new thing someday, I just didn't expect this limbo."" Whatever TikTok's ultimate intentions are for music, it is an effective means for artists to reach new fans, and there aren't many others left.  Labels are trying to catch up - Warner Music Group recently announcedits interest in buying Believe Music, the French parent firm of services like TuneCore that distribute independent and emerging artists (though the company later passed). ""TikTok is one of the few things that does seem to touch real people,"" Zitron said. ""But this is a problem for all creative media now. Where do you go to discover new music? The value of a song has been reduced to nothing, and the people controlling the mechanisms are disconnected from the actual creativity."" Columbia Records' Flanagan said that a course correction was overdue.  ""Artists should have unlearned having one platform being their main vehicle,"" Flanagan said. ""I knew people with massive Instagram audiences, and suddenly they change their algorithm and you can't reach your followers. You have to make sure you have email, texting, Discord, Substack, all of that. Trends change so quickly, you need to be able to transfer your superfans to other platforms."" ""Is TikTok still useful? Of course. But it does make you wonder if it's waned, or if they just have too much going on right now,"" Lee said. ""You can't be completely dependent on one platform to break artists. We have to think of a world where the platform is the artist and fans will follow you."" For someone like Hemlocke Springs, who used TikTok to succeed beyond her wildest dreams, she said she ""feels for emerging artists, especially ones under UMG right now,"" she said. ""The music biz's focus is on TikTok, and pulling that away from people sucks. But to solely rely on viral moments to push things off, that feels counterintuitive too."" For her, the new killer app is a very old one - playing great live shows.  ""I feel like touring is going to be an even bigger thing,"" she said. ""I'm going into these Doja shows assuming no one knows me, and the more I lean on that, the more it lights a fire under me."" This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"February 26, 2024",The Words of Support Your Teen Needs From You - & Which You Should Skip,246,"  Knowing what to say to teens can feel like an absolute mystery sometimes, considering that some days, even a simple ""good morning"" can push them over the edge. If you feel like you're often walking on eggshells with your teenager, let me reassure you that you are so not alone.  In my nearly 19 years of parenting, there have been many (many, many) situations where I didn't know what to say. In those moments, the pressure to choose the right words can feel so immense. Am I reacting in a way that sends the message I want to send? Will I fail them, and they'll remember it for the rest of their lives? When they're teenagers, these moments feel even more critical somehow - like saying the wrong thing could send them spiraling down a path of self-destruction. I'm sure a big part of that fear is just my worry-prone mom brain in action, but our teens really do need our guidance a whole lot during these years, whether they wanna admit it or not. And I don't know about you, but I'd love to feel more confident in giving it to them ... so I set out to find some answers.  What To Say to Teens ""Teens, developmentally speaking, have a high need for independence and a lack of judgment, especially from their parents,"" says clinical psychologist Hannah Yang, Psy.D., CEO and founder of Balanced Awakening. Dr. Yang tells SheKnows that teens need to figure things out for themselves and be allowed to make their own mistakes and learn from that ""real life"" experience: ""That's a framework to keep in mind when thinking about how to support your teen and what you might say."" Clinical and educational psychologist Aura De Los Santos, specialist at E-HEALTH project, says, ""Our teens need to hear direction, but not from an authoritarian position that creates fear."" Rather, De Los Santos tells SheKnows, teens need to feel understood, and our job is to guide them through their confusion. She suggests using phrases like, ""'You did it wrong, but you can learn from it,' 'We all make mistakes but it is important that you learn about the situation,' 'I understand how you feel, and I know it is not an easy situation,' or 'Even if you don't want to talk now, I want you to know that I will be waiting for you to be ready.'"" Dr. Yang offers additional suggestions: ""Some other things that might be good to say to a teen are, 'What do you need from me right now?' and 'Would you like my help/thoughts/support right now?' Asking questions like this is a way to let the teen know that you are there for them, but in a way that gives the power and autonomy to the teen to decide what and if they need their parents' help."" This viral TikTok proves that teenagers were just as relatable back then as they are now. https://t.co/mZi8KxaKAy - SheKnows (@SheKnows) September 6, 2023 What Not To Say to Teens ""Because I'm the parent, that's why."" Don't get me wrong here - our kids should absolutely respect our parental decisions! But according to Dr. De Los Santos, using this particular phrase isn't doing anybody any favors: ""Here you are not giving them details, there is no assertive response to the situation, and there is no understanding of the teenager's actions."" The ultimate goal, she says, is that they don't do things just because an authority figure dictates it, but because they understand the importance of the advice and support their parents give. And they'll never understand that our advice is important if they feel we're not listening, and simply shutting them down with ""because I said so."" ""It's not that big of a deal."" While we might feel like saying this will make our teens realize they shouldn't be so upset about something small, it actually sends the message that their parents don't care that they're upset. Dr. De Los Santos tells SheKnows that this comes across as a lack of empathy, which only serves to diminish how our kids feel instead of validating it. ""This can make them feel bad and misunderstood and unwilling to share other things,"" she says. ""You can't do that, you don't know anything about that."" Yes, teenagers do think they know everything, and it's tempting to knock that know-it-all attitude down a few pegs - but Dr. De Los Santos says that even though they are more inexperienced than they think they are, we should watch our phrasing: ""Saying it this way can affect teens' self-esteem.""  ""Why did you do that? What were you thinking?"" Dr. Yang advises avoiding questions like these that can come off as accusatory or blaming/shaming. ""Better to take a time out from your teen and not say anything until you can convey your concern or upset in a way that's less 'judgy,'"" she says. ""Doing so will help to preserve your relationship with the teen and help keep it feeling safe for them to come to you in the future when they need help, or just want to connect.""  How to Build Teens Up In the 'In-Between' Moments Even when we're not being confronted with a nerve-wracking parental situation involving our teenagers, they're still listening to what we say in the day-to-day (believe it or not!) - especially when we're bolstering their confidence about decisions they've made or things they're doing.  Dr. Yang reminds us to keep our eyes on the positives. ""It's easy as a parent of teens to focus on any 'problem' behaviors you might be seeing. But if you can instead focus on anything - or lots of things - that the teen is doing well with, that makes a huge positive impact on the teen's development and your relationship with them,"" she says. ""Even saying things like 'I noticed you kept your cool when you didn't get your preferred part in the musical,' or, 'The C you got on that math test shows you've been working hard to learn the material!' The more we can turn our attention to what we're liking and appreciating about our teen, the more likely they are to feel supported and want to open up and share more of their world with us."" Additionally, Dr. Yang recommends trying as best we can (though it's definitely hard!) to keep our judgments, and our own biases, in check. ""The more a parent can get ahold of their own 'stuff' or anxiety around what their teens behavior brings up for them, the better,"" she says. ""The more nonjudgmental and open of an approach a parent can take, and genuinely mean it, the better."" De Los Santos recommends honing in on four key points when it comes to developing and maintaining a positive relationship with our teens. Establishing effective communication. ""That is, communication where parents listen to their children, validate their emotions, and validate them in a way where they learn from their experiences,"" she says. Strengthening their self-esteem. De Los Santos reiterates the importance of focusing more on the good than on the bad: ""Parents should highlight positive aspects of their children and motivate them to be better every day."" Also, she says, we should let them see that it is normal to have weaknesses and reassure them that as they grow, they'll be able to turn those into strengths. Creating an environment of trust. The more comfortable our teens feel expressing their fears, concerns, beliefs, and values, says De Los Santos, the more likely they'll be to come to us about issues they're having - and trust our advice. Spending quality time with them. Finally, she advises hanging out with your kids as much as possible (we've got some expert advice on doing that, too!) - it's so important for their mental health, she says.  And when it comes to convincing them to spend quality time - which can be tricky - Dr. Yang has further advice. ""With teens, I think it's always great to sit back and observe,"" she says. ""Give them space, but approach them with curiosity when you notice they are passionate about or engaged with something. Ask them a question about what interests them about what you see them engaging in. Ask them about how they feel about a certain situation."" No matter how much expert advice we get on what to say to teens, there are still going to be those times when even the most innocuous comment will garner an irritated response (or at the very least, an epic eye roll). And there are no guarantees we'll never say anything wrong, because parenting teenagers is a near-constant string of scenarios we're just not sure how to handle. But with these guidelines to follow, we can at least be a little more assured that we're on the right track - and, just maybe, convince our kids that we know what we're talking about after all.  These celebrity parents are sharing the struggle - and sweetness - of raising teenagers.

"March 20, 2024","There's a clear way to regulate Facebook, TikTok and other online platforms; With Google, Amazon, X and others scaling back their safety teams, self-regulation is less likely, and AI poses big risks. A new government agency is the answer.",247,"  Powerful technology has perhaps never presented a bigger set of regulatory challenges for the U.S. government. Before the state primary in January, Democrats in New Hampshire received robocalls playing AI-generated deepfake audio recordings of President Biden encouraging them not to vote. Imagine political deepfakes that, say, incite Americans to violence. This scenario isn't too hard to conjure given new research from NYU that describes the distribution of false, hateful or violent content on social media as the greatest digital risk to the 2024 elections. The two of us have helped develop and enforce some of the most consequential social media decisions in modern history, including banning revenge porn on Reddit and banning Trump on Twitter. So we've seen firsthand how well it has worked to rely entirely on self-regulation for social media companies to moderate their content. The verdict: not well at all. Toxic content abounds on our largely unregulated social media, which already helped foment the attempted insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and the attempted coup in Brazil on Jan. 8, 2023. The dangers are only compounded with layoffs hitting the industry, the Supreme Court and Congress failing to address these issues head on, and inscrutable CEOs launching dramatic changes to their companies. Broad access to new and increasingly sophisticated technology for creating realistic deepfakes, such as AI-generated fake pornography of Taylor Swift, will make it easier to spread dupes. The status quo of social media companies in the U.S. is akin to having an unregulated flight industry. Imagine if we didn't track flight times or delays or if we didn't record crashes and investigate why they happened. Imagine if we never found out about rogue pilots or passengers and those individuals were not blacklisted from future flights. Airlines would have less of an idea of what needs to be done and where the problems are. They would also face less accountability. The lack of social media industry standards and metrics to track safety and harm has driven us to a race to the bottom. Similar to the National Transportation Safety Board and Federal Aviation Administration, there should be an agency to regulate American technology companies. Congress can create an independent authority responsible for establishing and enforcing baseline safety and privacy rules for social media companies. To ensure compliance, the agency should have access to relevant company information and documents and the authority to hold noncompliant companies accountable. If or when things go awry, the agency should have the authority to investigate what happened, much as the transportation board can investigate Boeing after its recent mishaps. Reining in social media harms is a difficult task. But we need to start somewhere, and attempts to ban platforms after they've already become hugely influential, as some U.S. lawmakers are trying to do with TikTok, just set up an unending game of whack-a-mole. Platforms can track the number of accounts taken down, the number of posts removed and the reasons why those actions were taken. It also should be feasible to build a companywide database of the hidden but traceable device IDs for phones and IP addresses that have been used to commit privacy, safety and other rule violations, including links to the posts and activities that were the basis for the decision to catalog the person and device. Companies should also share how algorithms are being used to moderate content, along with specifics on their safeguards to avoid bias (research indicates that, for example, automated hate speech detection shows racial bias and can amplify race-based harm). At minimum, companies would be banned from accepting payment from terrorist groups looking to verify social media accounts, as the Tech Transparency Project found X (formerly Twitter) to be doing. People often forget how much content removal already happens on social media, including child pornography bans, spam filters and suspensions on individual accounts such as the one that tracked Elon Musk's private jet. Regulating these private companies to prevent harassment, harmful data sharing and misinformation is a necessary, and natural, extension for user safety, privacy and experience. Protecting users' privacy and safety requires research and insight into how social media companies work, how their current policies were written, and how their content moderation decisions have historically been made and enforced. Safety teams, whose members do the essential work of content moderation and hold vital insider knowledge, have recently been scaled back at companies such as Amazon, Twitter and Google. Those layoffs, on top of the rising number of people pursuing tech careers yet finding uncertainty in the private tech sector, leave numerous individuals on the job market with the skills and knowledge to tackle these issues. They could be recruited by a new agency to create practical, effective solutions. Tech regulation is the rare issue that has bipartisan support. And in 2018, Congress created an agency to protect the cybersecurity of the government. It can and should create another regulatory agency to face threats from both legacy and emerging technologies of domestic and foreign companies. Otherwise we'll just keep experiencing one social media disaster after another.

"April 1, 2024",These Viral $22 Toner Pads Work Serious Magic on Dull Skin: 'I'm Literally Glowing Every Day',249,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. Truth be told, I am a sucker for cute packaging. If it comes in a cute shape or a pretty color (for me, it's any shade of pink), I'm going to be interested. That's exactly what happened when I went to my local beauty store and came across a display of Mediheal toner pads. After doing some quick digging, I found that these actually went viral on TikTok for not only its cute packaging, but the incredible results you get from using them. For just over $20 for a tub of 100 pads, they're not badly priced as well.  The Mediheal toner pads are currently available in seven options, and each one was made with a different skin concern in mind. For instance, the Watermide Moisture Pad was made for hydrating skin, while the Collagen Amoule Pad was made to help fight signs of aging like wrinkles, fine lines, and saggy skin. Now, if you're someone who finds toners completely useless or drying, these are totally different. They're basically little sheet masks soaked in essence that you can use like a skincare mask or wipe it across your face. Either way works.  In fact, shoppers can't stop raving over how amazing they are. As one reviewer said about the collagen pads, ""I literally love this product so much! "" had so many pores showing and my skin was dry, but that's all gone. My pores are not showing anymore and my skin is glowing as bright as my future.""  Another reviewer shopper said it's lazy girl approved writing, ""I gifted this to a friend for Christmas and she loves it! She never uses skincare because it can be complicated, but she loves how convenient this is! Her skin is literally glowing every day.""  If you want to test these out for yourself, you can snag them on Amazon for $22 for a set of 100. Check out a few of the most bought sets below.  Mediheal Watermide Moisture Pad $22 Buy Now If your skin could use a daily (or nightly!) boost of hydration, you may want to grab the Watermide Moisture Pad. These pads contains woodland forget-me-not flowers and Icelandic glacial water to ""intensively"" hydrate and cool dry, puffy, and coarse skin. They also help strengthen the skin's moisture barrier to prevent water loss and to keep you hydrated all throughout the day. These are the pads that I use nightly and I'm genuinely obsessed with them. After the first night of use, I woke up shocked at how soft and smooth a dry patch on my jaw was - and that had been an issue that's been bugging me for months. It's that good. I also have super sensitive/reactive skin that pretty much hates everything. So I was pleasantly surprised to find that this hasn't caused any reactions and I've been using this for months. It's a must buy for sure!  Mediheal Collagen Amoule Pad $22 Buy Now If you've seen these toner pads on TikTok, chances are, you've seen this cute pink tub. The Mediheal Collagen Amoule Pads were made to help with skin issues related to aging skin. We're talking wrinkles, fine lines, dryness, dullness, and overall crepey-ness.

A stuffy that can be snuggled or used as a fun throw pillow for a nap or plain ol' decor. If a pink dino isn't your aesthetic, there's also a green one, a unicorn, and Stitch (Yes, of Lilo & Stitch).

"March 28, 2024",They escaped a world of fast fashion to teach L.A. how to give old clothes new life,251,"  It's a rainy Wednesday evening at low-lit, moody Arts District hangout Tea at Shiloh, where a dozen students including myself perch on round white floor cushions, sipping carob cardamom tea and peering uncertainly at piles of denim on the low tables before us. Each of us has brought a ripped or damaged item of clothing from our closet, hoping to extend its life and keep it from the Goodwill bin. We're not here to hide our healing handiwork as talented seamstresses would, making tiny, nearly invisible stitches secreted under seams or camouflaged by the denim's color. Instead, Kim Krempien and Betsy Flores, clothing designers and founders of creative reuse collective Other Lives Studio, urge us in this workshop to make wildly colorful visible stitches that are also part of a larger creative design. To inspire us in our big, bold designs, Flores and Krempien have placed a mood board at the front of the room, displaying the styles of some of their embroidery influences: Maison Margiela, Jil Sander, Sashi.Co, and Yohji Yamamoto, to start. In one inspirational photo, a large multicolored butterfly spans the entire seat of a vintage pair of Miss Sixty jeans, while in another, shiny silver flowers splay across a Dries van Noten jacket. ""You think you have to take clothes to the tailor, who makes stitches perfectly invisible, but mending can be very visible, and that's our preference,"" Krempien says. Using electric blue and cherry red yarn, we seam together our denim rips over gentle chatter, creating decorative designs of clouds and triangles in the teahouse. At my table, one participant is pulling his very first stitch ever under Krempien's guidance, while a fashion student is creating swirls on a denim jacket. Flores comes around to gas us up, complimenting our progress. Stitching cloud outlines on the back pocket of my black jeans makes me feel like a little kid doodling, and I lose myself in the process as two hours race by. Our evening activity is quiet, alcohol-free and soothing - a vibe I wouldn't have expected from a gathering of mostly twenty- and thirty-somethings, but which a neighbor informs me is the norm at Shiloh. We leave with needles and thread to continue our projects at home. Flores and Krempien are part of an upcycling and creative reuse movement sweeping Los Angeles, one that eschews humble Stitch-and-Bitch sewing classes and crunchy crocheted hats for an eclectic, contemporary fusion of high fashion, Japanese mending techniques, do-it-yourself punk sensibility and environmental sustainability. As at creative reuse shops like Suay Sew Shop in DTLA and Remainders Creative Reuse in Pasadena, the goal isn't making a knit scarf for your dad so much as it is ripping up his old dress shirt and transforming it into a multicolored kimono, all with minimal effort. Other Lives calls itself a ""redesign atelier,"" which highlights its intentions to elevate old clothes to look as striking and experimental as couture, at a minimal cost to both the wearer and the environment. Other Lives isn't asking fashionistas to leave behind the outrageous world of high-end style; their workshops list influences of specific designers' seasons: for the keyhole tee workshop, it's Rick Owens Spring 2018, and for the marble dye workshop, it's Dries Van Noten Spring/Summer 2021. ""We want to toe the line between being accessible and inspirational,"" Krempien says. The founders come to the creative reuse culture from high-fashion backgrounds themselves, working with Nordstrom, Revolve and Vince. They met in 2016 at an industry event and eventually began an impassioned dialogue about sustainable fashion while working together to design and develop capsules for Nordstrom's Private Label Collections. Frustrated with fast fashion's toxic pollution of the Global South and Los Angeles' massive apparel industry, they vowed to start Other Lives, which would breathe fresh life into castoff clothing by facilitating revelatory workshops including metalwork and fabric painting. ""Fashion is an unsustainable process because it's producing too much to be a viable avenue,"" Krempien says. ""With original design manufacturing, you produce 30 to 40 or more samples per season, doing four collections a year, and it really adds up and becomes a space issue and a moral issue. I couldn't bear to keep thinking about creating this many unused garments, knowing that even when these samples go down the avenue of clothing donation, it's a broken system, where most of it is either landfilled or shipped to another country."" As they prepared to launch Other Lives' website in the spring of 2020, the pandemic canceled their first in-person workshop. They pivoted to online workshops, teaching exclusively through Zoom for two years and beginning in-person workshops in 2022. Flores says their skills, from strategic lacing design to jewelry collage, are learnable for anyone, even someone who's never sewn a stitch or fixed a necklace. ""When you think something is not feasible or beyond your skill set, it almost feels like you shouldn't even be trying,"" Flores says. ""Our workshops help take the pressure off, because you're in a community of people learning, and people are less intimidated and more open to trying and attempting not just what they've learned, but really anything. It's really an empowering opportunity as far as creativity goes."" Other Lives gives a starting point to uncertain upcyclers not only in the form of its workshops at Venia Studio, but also through its blog, TikTok, Instagram and YouTube videos. Last year, students in the jewelry collage workshop deconstructed and recombined old metal pieces, charms, pearls, stone beads, crystals, rings and chains into mixed media jewelry, while students in the lace workshop enlarged garments that no longer fit by creating lacing with grommets, loops and laces. Most fashion items are worn only seven to 10 times, which is making some consumers question not only their durability, but their versatility for wearing multiple times. Flores believes that part of the frustration is the lack of understanding of a garment, and how it can be creatively modified. She says that when a consumer sews or patches an item, they are less likely to dispose of it afterward. ""When you give an article of clothing a second life by editing it, you're creating a connection to the piece,"" she says. For Flores, there's meaning and spirituality in the items we wear. Coming on the heels of the Marie Kondo phenomenon, which mainstreamed the Shintoist-influenced practice of thanking an item for its service, Other Lives' name implies the power imbued in respecting a clothing item enough to revive it. Other Lives makes meaning out of old, cast-off clothes, drawing on the practices and philosophies of Japanese creative techniques like suminagashi dyeing, sachiko embroidery and kintsugi ceramics mending to see the redeeming spirit in an item, to repair the unrepairable. ""When you go thrifting or go to a flea market, from the moment you pick something up, you can't help but wonder what life it had,"" the designer says. ""I do believe things have energy, from whatever it meant to you and the memories and moments you created with it. Everything has potential, and that goes for us humans, too."" But empowering others to be creative and revamp their own clothing hasn't been enough for the duo, environmentally speaking. Other Lives also repurposes the development waste, including soles and foam, from its partnership companies, including Deckers Brands, which owns Ugg, Hoka and Teva, among other labels. In the future, Other Lives hopes to expand its educational offerings from one or two workshops a season to an array of diverse seasonal programming, using donations it's received. The collective also hopes to create DIY upcycling kits to sell, which upcyclers at home would use while following Other Lives YouTube tutorials. A creative reuse festival or retreat might even be in the cards someday, Flores says. In the meantime, Flores and Krempien urge those who can't attend a workshop to log onto social media to get inspired. ""Search 'DIY project,' 'upcycling' or 'creative reuse' on Pinterest, TikTok, Instagram,"" Krempien says. ""It's not just us, which is really amazing, because when we started we didn't know any other upcyclers. You'll find lots of projects to get inspired."" What you may end up with is an item unlike anything else in the world - a unique piece of artwork - which is what's so much fun about upcycling. ""Who doesn't want to feel unique and feel like a piece is personal to me?"" Flores says. ""It can also be a conversation starter, because when people see it, [they] will want to try it themselves.""

Krempien and Betsy Flores teach various techniques at their workshops repairing rips and tears in denim using 'invisible mending"" and embroidery, inspired by Japanese mending techniques sashiko and kintsugi. They also use paints to add to old clothing. They conduct the workshops at Venia Studio. Other Lives Studio is a concept hatched by friends and co-creators Flores and Krempien. Their workshops teach participants the skills and techniques to utilize deadstock fabric, pre-loved clothing and a thrifted miscellany of found objects as trims and materials to extend the life of clothing and jewelry.

"March 22, 2024",Think Kate Middleton's data-privacy fiasco is bad? US hospitals are under cyber-siege,252,"  Link to Image Data privacy officials in the United Kingdom are currently investigating a privacy breach that impacted the Princess of Wales, Kate Middleton, after three hospital workers reportedly sought access to the royal's private medical information. But her majesty's medical privacy problems are all too familiar for many in the United States, where one in three people were impacted by a health-related data breach last year. The Associated Press reported last month that one cybersecurity analyst counted 46 attacks on hospitals in 2023, compared with 25 in 2022, accounting for an astonishing 133 million US patient records exposed last year. And hackers are making more money per cyberattack, with average payouts jumping from $5,000 in 2018 to $1.5 million last year. ""Unless governments do something more meaningful, more significant than they have done to date, it's inevitable that it'll get worse,"" the analyst said.  The Department of Health and Human Services, however, said total health care hacks climbed to 725 last year, their highest on record. As reported by USA Today, the worst of the hacks (the top 20 in which at least 1 million records were exposed) the vast majority targeted hospital contractors and medical vendors. Around 2.3 million Medicare beneficiaries - along with tens of millions of people in 2,000 companies, government agencies and universities - had data exposed when a Russian ransomware group hacked US government software created by a federal contractor, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Following a massive cyberattack on a Chicago pediatric hospital on Jan. 31, officials from the US Department of Homeland Security likewise issued a warning: cyberattacks are growing quickly and hospitals are being targeted, along with doctors, medical vendors and other health care companies. More recently, HHS is currently investigating the massive Feb. 21 breach of a UnitedHealth Group subsidiary that likely exposed millions of patients' sensitive data. ""Given the unprecedented magnitude of this cyberattack, and in the best interest of patients and health care providers, OCR is initiating an investigation into this incident,"" the HHS Office for Civil Rights said in a statement last week. Three things the US could do to protect data privacy Although controversial legislative efforts to ban TikTok have captured much of the nation's attention, the more effective data-privacy move by Congress came this week as lawmakers in the House unanimously passed a bill barring third-party data brokers from selling your data to the US' geopolitical adversaries, like Russia and China. As reported by Gizmodo, the Protecting Americans' Data from Foreign Adversaries Act (H.R. 7520) cleared the House Wednesday on a 414-0 vote and is now headed for the Senate.  Want more health and science stories in your inbox? Subscribe to Salon's weekly newsletter Lab Notes. The bill also bolsters previous efforts by the Federal Trade Commission to shore up sensitive health data - barring brokers from selling or sharing information like your precise geolocation data, genetic data and private emails and texts. The Biden administration and Environmental Protection Agency are also moving to shore up state-level defenses while warning that ""disabling cyberattacks"" are hitting critical US water and waste systems, along with power grids. The administration has also recently pushed for better privacy-risk labeling on consumer smart-home devices and tech. What you can do to bolster your data privacy 1. Verify a breach If you'd like to check whether one of your email addresses has been compromised in a data breach or hack, you can visit haveibeenpwned.com and enter your email address in the site's search bar. The site's owner and creator, security expert Troy Hunt, has provided this free service since 2013, and the site can verify your email address against a database of nearly 8 billion compromised accounts. 2. Use credible, open source privacy tools When you finally get tired of having to keep track of (and routinely reset) dozens of passwords, consider installing open-source password manager Bitwarden in your browser. Usually, free privacy and cybersecurity tools are inadvisable, but Bitwarden is the exception. Offering the strongest free-tier service among competitors and compatible with nearly any browser, Bitwarden has nearly no learning curve and offers convenient instructions on importing your list of saved passwords. 3. Use decoy accounts and contaminate your data Any time you're entering your name into a website to sign up for a new service or place an order, use two things: a fake identity and email account (to the maximum extent allowable by law), and contaminated data. The fake identity bit is self-explanatory. Contaminating the data is simple: While entering your information into any online form, put the name of the website or service you're using into the field set aside for a middle name. For instance, if I start receiving junk mail and spam from random companies and it's addressed to ""Rae Amazon Hodge,"" I'll know exactly what company sold me out.

"February 27, 2024","This energetic dance party hides in a tiny L.A. bar - no cover, no line, no RSVPs",253,"  Under red lights, a man in a cowboy hat swings his partner around a crowded dance floor. House and disco play from a makeshift DJ booth. A tattooed woman with long, red fingernails grips a Buddha-shaped beer bottle. A fashionable couple takes selfies in matching red trucker hats emblazoned with the words ""Thai Angel."" They're two of the many patrons proud to show their loyalty to the bar and restaurant hosting this lively scene. It's late on a Saturday night in February and just a few hours earlier, there was no DJ and no dancing. Just regulars eating drunken noodles and fried rice at this unassuming spot in Koreatown. But when Thai Angel's tiny kitchen closes, the party starts. Through a community of devout regulars and an owner that embraces them, it's quietly become a drama-free, all-are-welcome place to dance from 9 p.m. until last call just before 2 a.m. No RSVP, no cover, no line outside. In the back of the L-shaped room, the bathroom line buzzes with strangers bonding over how they found Thai Angel and flexing how many times they've visited. It's the type of conversation you'd expect somewhere like Spotlight, a dress-to-impress nightclub that recently opened in Hollywood or at an underground warehouse party in East L.A. or downtown. But some young L.A. partygoers are tired of corporate-feeling clubs and exclusive or ticketed events. They've gone back to basics - favoring casual bar environments. Gen Z's recent discovery of 100-year-old Barney's Beanery has made the late-night roadhouse as hard to get into as the spots the new crowd was seemingly trying to avoid. Thai Angel has no glamorous Hollywood backstory or viral TikTok posts, yet the dance floor is still packed. Jamie Eich, 58, opened the first iteration of Thai Angel, named after her daughter, in 1995 as a karaoke bar in Hollywood. Eight years ago, on her daughter Salanya ""Angel"" Inm's 21st birthday, Jamie asked what she wanted. ""A bar,"" she answered. The current Thai Angel location on Western Avenue was her birthday gift. Thai Angel is co-owned by Jamie, Angel and her brother Boss Inm, 36. After college, Angel, now 29, began working as a waitress and bartender. Boss and Jamie are behind the bar at Thai Angel every day. Angel, who also works as a reiki practitioner and model, is preparing to open an alcohol-free tea lounge upstairs. The family never set out to make Thai Angel a nightlife hot spot. Sure, it poured strong drinks and stayed open late, but the first DJs to throw parties in the space were just regulars slurping down pad see ew at the bar. Most people inside tonight found the space through a party called SOUP. In 2020, eight friends in the music industry, including Swedish pop star Tove Lo, were looking for a place to throw an informal DJ night. They looked for a venue across L.A. but couldn't find the right fit, eventually giving up and grabbing a late-night dinner. They ended up at Thai Angel. The first SOUP was days before the city's pandemic stay-at-home orders in March 2020. The friends have since put on 13 events at the restaurant. Throwing dance parties at Thai Angel requires promoters to bring in their own DJ and speaker set up, but the environment is worth it. ""People have really responded to the unique feel of Thai Angel and the fun concept of SOUP's quick DJ rotation. The setting has a lot to do with it. L.A. nightlife is filled with things worth avoiding ... there are plenty of douchey clubs, trendy bars and overpriced and pretentious mixology. There are also fun spots where the owners have applied care and vision in order to create a fun and unique environment. Thai Angel is one of those spots,"" says SOUP member Samuel Luria. On party nights, the eight friends arrive early to enjoy an off-menu vegan tom kha soup prepared by Jamie, with plenty of leftovers for the rest of the week. Tonight, the crowd at Thai Angel is courtesy of DJ collective Friends of Friends of Friends. Previously, they threw house parties and DJed the occasional wedding, but the trio was inspired by SOUP and began throwing events at Thai Angel last September. ""Jamie immediately welcomed us as her family,"" said co-founder Collin Sommers, ""For a city known for its glitz and glam, there's a lot of authenticity in the spaces below the surface. Thai Angel is just one story, amongst many in L.A., of a women-owned, family-owned business that truly foster community."" Jamie, who is a single mother, enjoys her role as welcoming committee and secondary mom to Thai Angel patrons. Some regulars don't know her first name and refer to her only as ""Mom."" She encourages it. A handwritten note tacked to the bar displays her username for digital payments as ""Thai-Mom."" The nickname was popularized by DJ and actor Ian Alexander Jr, who died by suicide at 26. Jamie credits him for throwing weekly DJ nights starting in 2018 that laid the foundation for Thai Angel to become an if-you-know-you-know nightlife spot. ""He loved doing it. He'd greet me with 'Hi Mom how are you?' He made this place pop. I think that he's still here with us,"" she said. Angel believes the family-owned dynamic is responsible for the warm and welcoming environment. ""It's a very small, narrow space. It's cozy. In my mind it really does feel like a living room, a house party. People come here and they feel at home,"" she says. In addition to this spot, Jamie owns two bars in Bangkok, also named Thai Angel. ""We set goals here. Like Nike said, just do it,"" Jamie says. At midnight, a man bobs and weaves through the crowd holding a stack of giant pizza boxes. Jamie immediately waves him over to the last booth, where he begins giving out slices for free. Scotty Chappell, co-owner of Swizzle Pizza, an East Hollywood pop-up, has been coming to Thai Angel for seven years. He initially stumbled in while working at a restaurant down the street. Before opening Swizzle, Chappell and his business partners experimented with serving Thai pizzas out of the Thai Angel oven. ""Thai Angel has always been there for us. It's a chosen family in a city where that feels so hard to find. We're there for them too, whether it's helping them close up on busy nights, taking out the trash, washing dishes or bringing in a ton of pizza to feed a party so they can actually have a break from cooking their delicious Thai food,"" he says. At 1 a.m., the dance floor has no signs of slowing down. Jamie has changed into a ""I <3 Thai Angel"" T-shirt. Angel is passing out homemade lemon bars, courtesy of a regular who calls the bar their ""Cheers."" Across Los Angeles, the Saturday night crowd is waiting in line for a hot bar or racking up an Uber bill as they search for the next better party. If only they knew what was hiding in plain sight.

"January 10, 2024",This TikTok-Viral Stair Stepper Makes People 'Sore as Hell' & It's on Sale Right Now,255,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. One fun thing about me is that I don't need a calendar to know when winter hits - I can just look at my daily step counts, because they fall off a cliff every November. I like working out (no really, I do!) it's just that when the temperature starts to dip, there are about a thousand things I'd rather do than go for a run or walk. Yes, I could layer on my winter running clothes and go freeze my toes off for a couple miles, or I could bask on the couch in front of the heater, Netflix on, tea mug in hand, cookies within arm's reach. Luckily it's 2024, and long gone are the days when leaving the house was your only option for getting your cardio in. We're big proponents of cozy cardio here at SheKnows, which (for the uninitiated) basically means treating your cardio like self-care: turning on your favorite show, pulling on your softest leggings, sipping your favorite sports drink straight out of the prettiest Stanley cup you own. And if you don't have the room or budget for a full treadmill or Peloton bike in your living room, never fear. We just stumbled upon a tiny stair stepper that TikTok loves, and it's on sale on Amazon as we speak. Sunny Health & Fitness 2-in-1 Stepper Machine $62.99$87.9928% off Buy Now And yes, we're talking about stair steppers, not the Stairmaster machine you might be used to seeing at the gym, which is much bigger and bulkier. A stair stepper, and specifically the two-in-one stepper machine from Sunny Health & Fitness that TikTok loves, is just over a foot tall about 16 inches wide. (It does weight about 16 pounds, FYI.) It consists of two foot pedals, a digital monitor to track your steps, time, and calories burned, and adjustable screws so you can change the height or intensity of your workout at any time. The size alone is a big selling point. Unlike a treadmill or exercise bike, you can quickly move this stair stepper from room to room, whether you want to work out in front of the TV, in the kitchen while your kids have breakfast, or while working at your standing desk. When you're done, it's small enough to stash under the couch or bed. We also love that the stepper comes with detachable resistance bands for upper-body moves like rows or bicep curls. The stepper by itself will work your legs and increase your heart rate, so adding the bands makes it a seriously efficient full-body workout. These stair steppers first started to go viral on TikTok back in November, with creators like @lagaelle02 popularizing them with short, dance-inspired full-body workouts. Now that we're fully in thick of winter, it's seems everyone wants to get their hands on a stair stepper. ""It looks easy, but it is a workout,"" said creator @asiajae24. ""I'm sore as hell, but baby, this thing works, and all I've been doing is 10 minutes a day,"" she elaborated in a later video. ""Don't underestimate this! I feel it in my legs, my booty."" Other creators like @janessadanielle29 tried the stepper while doing squats (my thighs are burning just thinking about it) and curls, while others simply set it up in front of the TV and pounded out 10K steps(!). One thing to note: the Sunny Health & Fitness stepper lists a max weight of 220 pounds, but another brand that creators tried out, the Niceday stepper, goes up to 300. (And, coincidentally, is also on sale on Amazon.) And if you're the kind of person who likes to work out in a class setting or with an instructor, Sunny Health & Fitness and other creators offer free videos on YouTube. Niceday Stair Stepper with Resistance Bands $79.99$99.9920% off Buy Now We all have our preferences when it comes to cardio (and workouts in general), but if your main concern is convenience and not having to leave your house - again, so key in the winter - this affordable, mini-sized stepper is a good place to start.

"February 15, 2024",This Viral Beauty Brand Dropped a New Multitasking Conditioner That Transforms Thinning Hair & Shoppers Are Already Impressed,257,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. Finding the right conditioner is essential when you're working with thinning or damaged hair. After all, you don't want to weigh your hair down or apply a product that's only going to lead to further damage or loss. As you've probably seen, there's no shortage of products out there promising to deliver ""miracle""-like results on thinning hair, but very few actually live up to the hype. If you haven't had any luck finding a shampoo or conditioner that actually helps your hair, don't give up hope just yet. A new line of products for thinning hair recently dropped and shoppers are seriously impressed.  A few years back, everyone from TikTok to makeup artists, to celebs like Brooke Shields and Hilary Duff, raved over Grande Cosmetics' GrandeLASH-MD Lash Enhancing Serum. In short, the serum actually worked at delivering lashes that were noticeably fuller-looking without the use of mascara. Not only that, their brow productshave also gotten positive reactions from shoppers.  Just recently, Grande Cosmetics dropped the GrandeHair Full Boost Collection at Ulta, which features a shampoo, a volumizing foam, and a multitasking conditioner that were all made for thinning and/or damaged hair. All three products are under $30 each, which is pretty good considering similar products from other high-end beauty brands can cost closer to $50 a piece. While all three are definitely worth adding to your routine, the conditioner caught our interest for the amount of things it can do to help your hair.  GrandeHAIR Full Boost Conditioner Buy Now $28 The GrandeHAIR Full Boost Conditioner is described as a ""multitasking"" product that does everything from adding ""intense hydration"" and reducing breakage, to giving your hair a healthy shine. According to the brand, if used consistently, the conditioner can help strengthen your hair and make it three times more resistant to breakage. Over time, you'll notice your hair looking and feeling healthier and fuller. Naturally, for best results, it's highly recommended to use after the GrandeHAIR Full Boost Shampoo.  Although the conditioner dropped recently, it's already being described as ""amazing"" and has glowing reviews from shoppers. As one Ulta reviewer wrote, ""This conditioner definitely lives up to its description. My hair feels healthy, soft, and fuller."" It's also worth nothing that the conditioner has fragrance notes of violet, iris, and sandalwood. So, don't be surprised to get a ton of compliments on the amazing scent.  Another reviewer wrote, ""I recently started using this hair conditioner and am absolutely thrilled with the results. One of the most noticeable changes is the increase in volume of my hair. It's like every strand has gained volume and overall my hair looks much fuller. The smoothness and softness of my hair has also improved dramatically. It also does a great job of detangling hair and doesn't weigh it down. A very pleasant floral scent. I highly recommend trying it!""  One was very impressed with the results writing, ""This isn't just a conditioner; it's a love letter to my hair, a transformative experience that supports the appearance of thicker, healthier-looking strands every time I indulge in its magic. It's lightweight and effortless. When it comes to my self-care, my hair deserves nothing but the best.""  If you want to see whether this conditioner (and the rest of the GrandeHAIR Full Boost line) can help with your thinning hair, be sure to head over to Ulta.com today. After all, Grande Cosmetics did go viral for a hair-boosting product once before, we doubt this new line of products will disappoint.

"February 22, 2024","This Viral Juicy Lip Balm That Shoppers Can't Get Enough of Just Launched in a New Shiny Formula for a Hydrated, Glossy Pout",258,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. I'm definitely a fan of glossy lips. It's my go-to lip look, no matter what. However, I'm not a fan of putting on lip balm beforehand (go ahead, call me lazy - I don't care). I know it's a simple step to do beforehand, but I often forget to, and sometimes I just really can't be bothered. Luckily for me (and you, if you share my pain), Tarte just launched its cult-favorite Maracuja Lip in a new shiny formula that'll take care of that problem instantly. If you're not big on TikTok (don't worry, neither am I), you might've missed how the internet could not stop talking about Tarte's Maracuja Juicy Lip products. Ranging from a moisturizing balm to a volumizing lip-plumper, beauty lovers far and wide seriously love them - and for good reason. Thanks to Tarte's signature ingredient, Maracuja, which is high in vitamin C, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids, all products nourish your lips while providing a pretty pigment. Now, a new Maracuja Juicy Lip is on the scene that's totally deserving of our attention.  Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Vinyl $26 Buy Now on Tarte $26 Buy Now on sephora The new Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip Vinyl perfectly combines a moisturizing balm, an ultra-shine gloss, and a pigmented lip color in one product. It has all the same benefits as the Juicy Lip Balm, with the addition of their WetShine complex that offers a glossy, mirror-shine finish that gives you a juicy wet look that all gloss girls love. There are eight high-shine and shimmer finishes available, ranging from soft nudes and pretty pinks, to classic reds and deep browns.  You can now get the new Maracuja Juicy Lip Vinyl on Tarte.com and Sephora.com today. Currently, only the shimmer shades are available on Tarte's website, so if you want them, you better hurry before they sell out.

"March 27, 2024",This Wayfair Sectional Is TikTok's New Favorite Couch & Shoppers Can't Stop Raving About It,259,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. Say what you will about TikTok, but there's no denying that we've found some of our favorite things thanks to the creators we follow on the app. From viral recipes to skincare routines, workout ideas to home decor inspiration, TikTok has it all. But the latest find could be the coziest of all. It's a roomy sectional from Wayfair that's big enough for the whole family, and has hundreds of five star ratings and reviews. It might even be better than the TikTok Cloud Couch. @kiara.figs Found the perfect couch for movie nights #wayfairfinds #couch #movies #homedecor #livingroom #greencouch #fyp #home #espinosacouch #sectional #sectionalcouch original sound - kardashianshulu The Espinosa 6-Piece Corduroy Sectional from Wayfair comes in five different colors to match your style, whether classic or modern: beige, dark gray, dark green, ginger, and dark blue. The corduroy fabric is soft and cozy, and reviewers say the couch is ""comfortable, versatile, soft, and durable."" Others can't believe how big it is. ""This is the most incredible, huge, comfy, beautiful, dream come true couch!"" exclaimed one reviewer, while another said, ""Warning - fights will break out over the corner seats,"" thanks to how comfortable they are. Wayfair Willa Arlo Interiors Espinosa Corduroy Sectional $1869.99 Buy Now Worried about assembling such a big couch? Wayfair has you covered. This item comes with free White Glove Delivery, which Wayfair explains means that, ""We'll carry your item to a room of your choice, assemble (if needed), and remove all packaging."" Since this couch comes in six boxes, that's a huge help. The sectional has five roomy seat cushions, and one ottoman. The ottoman can be added to one end of the sectional to create a chaise lounge-style seat, or it can be pushed into the center of the sectional so you have one giant bed-like couch that's perfect as an extra spot for guests to sleep when they're in town, for sleepovers, and for the coziest movie nights ever. The corduroy upholstery is durable, and the fabric isn't dry clean only, a strange feature we've noticed on some couches. Like, are we supposed to bring the couch to the dry cleaner in a rented U-Haul when we spill wine, or...? The covers of the cushions can't be removed to be put in the washer, but they can be spot cleaned with dishwashing soap and water, and a Bissell Little Green would likely be a safe bet, too. That's great news, because we have a feeling this giant couch is going to get a lot of use, from kids scrambling around and pets taking naps, and hopefully from the grown-ups in the house getting to relax now and then too. Don't forget - the person who bought the couch gets dibs on a corner seat!

"February 29, 2024","TikTok Says You Shouldn't Rinse After Brushing Your Teeth, So We Asked the Experts - & Tried It Out",263,"  It all started with a TikTok, like many of my wellness-trend questions do these days. Specifically, this was a TikTok from a dental hygienist, @krystaambruson, who shared her morning oral hygiene routine and ended with a surprising (for me) instruction: do not rinse your mouth after brushing your teeth. The reasoning makes sense - you don't want to wash the fluoride off your teeth, Ambruson explains (more on that later) - but the thought of leaving my toothpaste residue to just sit in my mouth for the rest of the morning was, well, slightly gross.  It's also strange to think that - if TikTok is to be believed - the common habit of rinsing after brushing your teeth isn't actually a best practice for oral hygiene. I don't know anyone that doesn't rinse after brushing. Isn't that why hotels have cups in the bathroom? What other lies have we been told?! Clearly I needed answers, and I wanted to go beyond TikTok to get them. I asked three dentists whether we really should be rinsing after we brush (or floss, for that matter) and, while we were at it, what other changes we should make to our dental hygiene routines. Turns out, TikTok might be on to something with this one, so let's talk about why. Should you rinse after brushing your teeth? You shouldn't rinse with water right after brushing your teeth, dentists say. Why? ""Toothpaste contains fluoride, which helps remineralize and strengthen the tooth's enamel,"" cosmetic dentist Dr. Catrise Austin of VIP Smiles tells SheKnows. ""If you're rinsing immediately after brushing, you risk washing away the fluoride before it has a chance to fully protect your teeth.""  Still, it's understandable why rinsing after brushing is so common. ""It feels good in the mouth and helps to get rid of any toothpaste residue that may not taste the best,"" Dr. Shahrooz Yazdani, dentist and director of Yazdani Family Dentistry Kanata, tells SheKnows. But if you want to get the most bang for your buck when it comes to your oral hygiene routine, it's best to skip this step.  Instead, simply spit out any excess saliva or toothpaste after brushing and leave the trace residue behind on your teeth, Dr. Jennifer Silver, dentist and owner at Macleod Trail Dental, tells SheKnows. Avoid eating or drinking for at least 10 minutes after brushing ""to allow the fluoride to work its magic,"" she adds. While it's best not to rinse at all after brushing, if you really don't want to skip that step, ""use a small amount of water and avoid swishing vigorously,"" Austin says. And if you have a fluoride rinseyou like to use after brushing, Yazdani recommends brushing, rinsing with a bit of water, then following up with the fluoride rinse. Quick personal tangent: since seeing that TikTok, I decided to stop rinsing after brushing my teeth. At first, I didn't love the half-chalky, half-slimy residue the toothpaste left behind. It was also surprisingly hard to break the habit of rinsing, something I've done my whole life, and a few times, I would slurp down a mouthful of water before I realized what I was doing. (This was especially common in the morning, when I was half asleep.)  But as I got used to it, the toothpaste aftertaste started bothering me less and less, and it felt more normal to spit without rinsing. Now it barely fazes me and I've made it a consistent part of my routine. Should you rinse after flossing? The time to rinse, it turns out, is actually after flossing. The idea is that rinsing after your floss ""can help remove any loosened food particles and bacterial plaque from between your teeth,"" Austin explains, so make a point to swish around some water and spit after you toss out your floss. Speaking of...  Should you floss before or after brushing? While we're talking about brushing and flossing, let's answer this age-old question too. ""It's generally recommended to floss before brushing,"" Austin says. That's because flossing cleans the space between your tooth and your gum, so that when you do go in and brush, ""this allows the fluoride from the toothpaste to reach between your teeth more effectively,"" Austin says. You're basically maximizing your ""protection against cavities that form in hidden areas like between the teeth and below the gums,"" she explains. The ideal order? Floss, rinse with water, brush with fluoride toothpaste, and end with a fluoride rinse if you use one, Yazdani says. If you prefer an alcohol-based mouthwash, ""use this after flossing but before brushing,"" he says, ""as alcohol can also remove the fluoride."" In short: it's best to floss before brushing and skip rinsing after brushing, but if you really prefer to rinse (or just have a hard time remembering not to), don't stress. ""If you have a habit of rinsing with water, it really is not the worst thing for your dental hygiene,"" Yazdani says. The most important thing, he says, is brushing and flossing twice a day. Once you've got that healthy habit down, finessing your routine can help you get the absolute most out of it. (Your teeth will thank you.)

"December 1, 2023","TikTok video of San Bernardino arrest shows punches, knees to the face; cop under investigation",264,"  A TikTok video showing an arrest by San Bernardino police in which a man is pinned to the ground and pummeled with fists and a knee to the face has led to an internal investigation.  Cellphone video from a witness captured the incident, and an officer involved has been placed on modified assignment while the investigation is underway. The video shows two officers arresting a man. One officer is seen pinning him while another punches and knees the man in the head multiple times. The officers appear to instruct him to place his hands behind his back and stop resisting. The man seems to cry out in pain. A third officer arrives on the scene as the man is being arrested.  Edward Obayashi is a lawyer and former Plumas County sheriff's deputy who advises departments throughout California about use-of-force incidents. Although he described the incident as ""ugly,"" he told The Times there was nothing in the footage that led him ""to believe that this force was unreasonable."" ""There's no such thing as a pretty use-of-force video,"" he noted. ""It just doesn't exist. When you see it, it's graphic, it's ugly. He was able to get up on his feet and they handcuffed him without incident."" Obayashi cautioned that it was best to wait for the conclusion of an investigation before making a judgment.  The San Bernardino Police Department is no stranger to allegations of officers using excessive force. The department is facing a $100-million lawsuit, filed last year, in the fatal shooting of 23-year-old Black man Rob Adams. An independent autopsy from 2022 suggested Adams, allegedly armed, was shot multiple times from behind. The incident recorded in the TikTok video occurred Monday after a high-speed chase of a suspected stolen vehicle in a residential neighborhood near West 50th Street and Electric Avenue North in San Bernardino. During the chase, the suspect lost control of the car and crashed into a telephone pole.  Lt. Jennifer Kohrell declined to identify the police officers involved. San Bernardino Police Chief Darren Goodman issued a statement saying, ""We will take the necessary steps to correct any officer's actions that are inconsistent with protecting our community, providing quality service, and fostering trust."" This story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.

"October 11, 2023",TikTok's Favorite Deodorant That Kills B.O. 'in Any Crevice' Is 26% Off for Prime Day,269,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. If TikTok swears by a product, you know we have to check it out. That's the case with the viral Lume Whole Body deodorant, which TikTokers have been raving about for months for its excellent scent, long-lasting coverage, and aluminum-free ingredient list. And now is definitely the time to buy this popular brand, because Lume deodorant stick and body cream are on sale for up to 26 percent off thanks to Amazon's October Prime Day sales. If you're a fan of natural deodorants, you already know that they come at a cost - and we mean that literally, because products like aluminum-free deodorants like Lume and Native can be upwards of $15 per stick. For Prime Day, you can buy a set of two Lume deodorant sticks for as low as $23, or a stick and body cream combo pack for $24 (aka 20 percent off). Solid savings, especially for a product that's been flying off the shelves for months.  Lume Whole Body Deodorant Stick - Two-Pack$23.59$31.9826% Off Buy now So what is it about Lume that users love? For one thing, Lume seems to really last. Both the stick and cream are advertised to last for 72 hours, and even if they don't quite make it that long every time, TikTokers reported that the scents really did stay strong. ""I went on a walk, I got home, I smelled my armpits, they still smelled good,"" says one creator, who says she has hyperhydrosis, akaexcessive sweating. ""Even before I went to bed I had no odor. And I just woke up, about to take a shower, and I have no odor."" According to other creators, Lume stays strong through hot yoga, sweaty summer concerts, and days of 100-degree weather in Texas.  @nicolefay_ Thank me later #lumedeodorant #deodrant #targetfinds #targetmusthaves original sound - Nicole Fay Then there's the whole-body functionality. Lume's deodorant sticks and cream are designed to be used all over, not just in your armpits, in areas like your feet, cleavage/underboob, thighs, and tummy rolls. TikTok really loves the cream for this purpose. ""This works for me. This is it,"" says one creator. ""I feel so good about a deodorant that I can actually rub into my skin."" One Amazon reviewer says they use it where their belly hangs over their jeans ""and it reduced and almost eliminated the odor in that area."" They note that the deodorant doesn't fully dry ""when used in that areas (& I imagine any crevice),"" but that it's worth the odor control. ""It's a pretty life-altering product for pesky areas,"" they write. Lume also offers lots of different scents, including Clean Tangerine, Peony Rose, Lavender Sage, and the super-popular Toasted Coconut, plus a non-scented option. For Prime Day, all versions of the body cream are on sale along with most of the stick options. Lume Whole Body Deodorant Stick and Body Cream$24.78$30.9820% Off Buy now Of course, as with all TikTok-recommended products - and all deodorants in general, TBH - not everyone is into every Lume scent. A few TikTok creators also reported feeling rashes after using Lume, so we recommend trying a bit on a non-sensitive area of skin (such as your arm) to see how your body responds before applying it to either your pits or your privates (or beyond). (Note, too, that doctors typically recommend avoiding scented lotions or sprays on or around your genitals, as they can disrupt your natural bacterial balance.) If you're ready to give this viral brand a try, Lume deodorant sticks and the Lume lotion and stick combo pack are both on sale through the end of Prime Day (aka today!) so grab yours now and enjoy the sunny scents and effective odor control. As a reminder, this and all the incredible discounts you can score during October's Prime Day are for Amazon Prime members. If you're not a member just yet, be sure to sign up HERE to take advantage of all the great savings from Amazon Prime Big Deal Days 2023.

"January 19, 2024",TikTok's Favorite Lip Mask Comes in a New Limited Edition Set for Valentine's Day - Get It Before It Sells Out Again,271,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. Don't you love it when a brand listens to its fan base? It just makes you fall more and more in love with it and its products. Well, LANEIGE - the K-Beauty brand that took TikTok over by storm with its iconic Lip Sleeping Mask - did just that. Last year, it released a limited-edition lip duo for Valentine's Day that sold out instantly. It featured the original berries-flavored Lip Sleeping mask and a rare chocolate-flavored Lip Sleeping Mask that everyone couldn't wait to get their hands on. LANEIGE brought the Berries 'N Choco Kisses Set back this year but better than before.  Released earlier this week, the new Kisses Set still features a mini version of the rare chocolate Lip Mask and now a full-size berry Lip Glowy Balm. As a beauty enthusiast, I love the Lip Glowy Balm. It's a little easier to apply than the Lip Sleeping Mask, especially when you're on the go. The Lip Glowy Balm has the same sheer-pink hue that we all know and love from Laniege, while the chocolate lip mask has the prettiest light brown tint that offers a very natural look. So, if you love the iconic '90s brown lip, this kit is for you.

"January 17, 2024","TikTok's Newest Walking Trend Sounds Strange, but It Might Just Get Rid of Your Knee Pain",275,"  We love a good TikTok trend, but you really have to be... discerning about the ones you try, especially when they promise to change some aspect of your health or body. (Vagina trends, we're looking at you.) But that's not to say that your For You page doesn't have some gems to offer when it comes to health and fitness (silent walking is one of our favorites), and we recently found one that might actually work. It's called retro walking, and it's basically regular walking... but backwards. And it might just have some serious benefits. If you're rolling your eyes, let us explain. Walking backwards, also called retrograde walking or retro walking, is done either outside or on a treadmill, and it's exactly what it sounds like: walking while facing the opposite direction that you're moving. TikTok creator @Kali.ot, an occupational therapist, calls walking backwards ""the best thing you can do to make your knees stronger,"" saying, ""I add a few minutes of this to my workout and it makes a huge difference."" MMA fighter @kaytlinkatnissmma is a fan for similar reasons. ""I had two knee surgeries within a year period,"" she explains in one video. ""I've seen a huge difference in my knees ever since I've started walking backwards. I love it."" Sounds promising, but we wanted to ask a few experts to make sure walking backwards can actually benefit our knees before we hop on the treadmill. Walking backwards: benefits for knee pain ""Backwards walking can be beneficial for individuals with knee pain,"" physical therapist Dody Deavours of AICA Orthopedics tells SheKnows, because it actually reduces stress on your knee joints. ""Backwards walking emphasizes the posterior muscle groups, such as the hamstrings and glutes, rather than the quadriceps, which are typically overused in traditional forward walking,"" Deavours explains. That shift in muscle engagement can lead to ""a more balanced muscle strength around the knee, potentially reducing pain and improving joint function."" Plus, backwards walking can help you ""enhance gait mechanics and hamstring flexibility,"" physiotherapist Louise Hateley of In Stride Clinic tells SheKnows. Decreasing the impact on your knees like this can have some surprisingly effective results. Deavours notes that it can help people suffering from conditions like patellofemoral pain syndrome (pain in the front of the knee or around the kneecap) or knee osteoarthritis (a degenerative joint disease usually caused by cartilage wear and tear, per Cleveland Clinic). And the science backs it up, with 2019 study finding that a six-week backwards walking program helped reduce pain and disability while strengthening quad muscle strength in patients with knee osteoarthritis. How to walk backwards safely Walking backwards sounds simple, but it's important to start slowly, Hateley cautions. ""Utilize the handrails [on the treadmill] to help you balance and start with five- to 10-minute sessions,"" she suggests. ""As your comfort and stamina increase, you can progressively extend the duration."" Deavours recommends doing two to three of these short sessions per week to start, as long as it doesn't worsen any existing knee pain. You can walk backwards on a treadmill or outside. While walking outside is more accessible, using a treadmill is typically safer because ""it provides a predictable, flat surface and handrails for balance,"" Deavours says. ""If opting for outdoor walking, choose a familiar, flat path and have a companion for safety."" You should also make sure to wear comfortable, supportive shoes, keep your posture straight, and prioritize safety (no trips, slips, or falls here). And while walking backwards can definitely help with knee pain within a larger strengthening or rehab program, ""it shouldn't take the place of other necessary exercises,"" Hateley notes. If knee pain is something you struggle with, Deavours adds, other ways to find relief include strengthening the muscles around your knees (quads, hamstrings, glutes), stretching your lower body muscles, and doing low-impact activities like swimming and cycling to relieve stress on the knee.

"April 4, 2024","TikToker blasted for saying ""SNL"" has never hired a hot woman",276,"  Link to Image In a now viral video posted to TikTok, a user who goes by the name Jahelis makes the truly wild declaration that in just under 50 years, ""Saturday Night Live"" has never cast a ""hot woman"" as part of the show's core ensemble. And the reactions to that swing and miss have not been favorable.  ""They all just kind of have looks that eventually grow on you,"" Jahelis says, using current cast member Heidi Gardner as her first example although, in the clip, she blanks on her name while repeatedly using the word ""skit"" when it should be ""sketch."" Being that ""Saturday Night Live"" is a sketch comedy show and all. ""They make every skit that she's in - at least one skit per episode she's in - being like where she plays someone super hot and super dumb and the point of the joke is that she's super pretty. And it always makes me laugh because, no offense to her, but she's not that pretty,"" she says of Gardner, later adding, ""Why don't they hire better looking people? It's TV?"" Jumping to the defense of Gardner, the ghost of Gilda Radner and themselves, cast members Chloe Troast and Sarah Sherman fired back at Jahelis' comments. ""Just found out i'm not hot. Please give me and my family space to grieve privately and uglily at this time,"" Sherman said in a post to X (formerly Twitter.) just found out i'm not hot. please give me and my family space to grieve privately and uglily at this time. https://t.co/YXvXMGvbYN - SARAH SQUIRM (@SarahSquirm) April 1, 2024 Sharing the video to Instagram as she sang Christina Aguilera's ""Beautiful,"" Troast offered Jahelis the two-bird salute. https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5RtbssOvCl/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_rid=a4d3b487-d2a1-45e9-ad26-d0d822b7ed10 ""I never expected that video to go viral,"" the content creator said in a statement following the backlash.

"December 18, 2023",Tom Brady's Family Photo Was Inadvertently Sent to a Stranger & He Was Quick To Play the Blame Game,277,"  One mom of four was in for a major surprise when she went to have a family photo developed at CVS this week. Instead of receiving the sweet picture of her kids dressed in their beloved San Francisco 49ers gear, she was given a photo of Tom Brady and his kids Jack, 16, Benjamin, 14, and Vivian, 11 in their Patriots gear. What?! Katie Tonges - one of the kids in the original photo - posted a now-viral TikTok showing the intended picture, the picture her family was sent, and a screenshot from her ""Fam Bam"" group chat. At the bottom was the picture of the Bradys and a message from ""Daddyo."" ""Mom sent in a picture of you kids to CVS to give grandma for Christmas. We just received them today and instead of you guys we get Tom Brady and his kids,"" he said before a bunch of laughing emojis and question marks. ""We can do a trade if you have our photo...??"" Tonges captioned her post, calling out Brady on TikTok. The twice-retired quarterback quickly responded to the video and had no problem jokingly pointing fingers. ""My mom must have been printing some photos out in San Francisco ,"" he said.  Vivian, Benjamin, and Jack Brady (Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images) Because suuure, it muuust have been mom. It's OK if you were going old school and printing out photos, Tom! And in SanFran, no less! Brady's parents, Tom Sr. and Galynn reportedly live in San Mateo, CA, which is about 30-40 mins outside San Francisco. So it's not entirely impossible that Mama Brady really did mix things up. Honestly, though, we'd like to think it was just the weirdest glitch in the CVS system. The pharmacy responded by saying, ""GMOAT (Greatest Mom of All Time) ?,"" because apparently they're Team Blame Mom too. *Sigh*  Tonges replied to Brady saying they can do a photo swap the next time the former Patriots quarterback is in town. And NFL fans from all over the country are eating this hilarious mistake up. ""The best part is that you're in 49s merch ,"" one comment said. Because we love a trolling twist of fate whereby the Tonges family ends up with the most Patriots-y photo and Brady's mom (hopefully!) ends up with their San Francisco photo.

"March 25, 2024",Top billionaire GOP megadonor had big stake in company in Trump's Truth Social deal: report,278,"  Link to Image Jeff Yass, a billionaire Republican megadonor, was the biggest institutional shareholder of a shell company that merged with former President Donald Trump's social media company last week, according to the New York Times. A December filing shows that Yass' firm Susquehanna International Group owned 2% of Digital World Acquisition Corp., which on Friday merged with Trump Media & Technology Group, which owns Truth Social. The stake was worth about $22 million based on the last closing price, according to the report. It's unclear if the firm still owns those shares, but if it does, it would make it one of Trump Media's biggest institutional shareholders following the merger, according to the Times. ""Susquehanna is a market maker and has zero economic interest in Trump Media,"" the company said in a statement. ""The firm's long position is offset by short positions of the same size."" Filings show that the firm used offsetting securities to try to minimize its gains or losses in the stock, according to the report. Yass is also a major shareholder in ByteDance, which owns TikTok. The House earlier this month voted to force the company to sell TikTok. Trump, who previously supported banning TikTok in the U.S., reversed his stance ahead of the bill shortly after a meeting with Yass, though he said the two never discussed TikTok. A source close to Trump's campaign told the Times that Yass was expected to give a large donation to a group backing Trump but Yass through a spokesperson said he has never donated to Trump and has no plans to do so.

"February 8, 2024",Trump Called 'Racist' for Saying 'Invasion' -- Is it Still Racist When Sharpton Says It?,279,"  When former President Donald Trump during his time in office called the massive influx of illegal immigration an ""invasion,"" the media denounced him as ""racist."" Consider this headline in The Atlantic: ""Why Trump Uses 'Invasion' to Describe Immigrants."" The article ripped Trump's ""racist language"": ""If you want to know the roots of the 'immigration invasion' rhetoric that President Donald Trump has championed time and again and which was echoed in the racist manifesto linked to the man held for the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas, last weekend you can find them in the anti-Chinese diatribes that circulated on the West Coast a century and a half ago."" CNN wrote: ""Trump Shocks with Racist New Ad Days Before Midterms"": ""The Trump ad also flashes to footage of the migrant caravan of Central American asylum seekers that is currently in Mexico, which Trump says is preparing an invasion of the United States, implying that everyone in the column of people fleeing repression, poverty and economic blight is bent on murder and serious crime on US soil."" A Time Magazine headline read: ""Donald Trump's Anti-Immigration Rhetoric is Rooted in Racism. Trump's Anti-Immigrant Rhetoric Was Never About Legality It Was About Our Brown Skin."" But in a recent interview, MSNBC's Al Sharpton, a left-wing flamethrower with impeccable Trump-hating credentials, pulled out the ""I word."" Speaking to a stunned Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), one of the authors of a proposed immigration bill, Sharpton went full Trump: ""You are seeing an influx of migrants all over the country that, frankly, have people outraged. ... Why are you allowing this to continue? ... I mean, we're looking every day at the invasion of migrants, and they are playing a time game with politics on this?"" Neither The Atlantic, CNN nor Time slammed Sharpton for his ""racist rhetoric."" On illegal immigration, many Democrats used to sound like Trump before Trump. In a 1993 speech, Nevada Sen. Harry Reid said: ""If making it easy to be an illegal alien isn't enough, how about offering a reward for being an illegal immigrant? No sane country would do that, right? Guess again. If you break our laws by entering this country without permission and give birth to a child, we reward that child with U.S. citizenship and guarantee a full access to all public and social services this society provides. And that's a lot of services."" Reid later apologized. In 2005, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama said: ""We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked, and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently, and lawfully to become immigrants in this country."" In 2009, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer said: ""First, illegal immigration is wrong. And a primary goal of comprehensive immigration reform must be to dramatically curtail future illegal immigration. ... People who enter the United States without our permission are illegal aliens and illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the U.S. legally."" Goodness, didn't even say ""undocumented."" December 2023 set a record for monthly illegal entries at 371,000, an average of nearly 12,000 a day. In 2019, President Barack Obama's former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said: ""And I'd look at [the numbers] every morning, it be the first thing to look at ... My staff will tell you if it under 1,000 apprehensions the day before, that was a relatively good number. If it was above 1,000 it was a relatively bad number and I was going to be in a bad mood all day."" The top issue during the Iowa caucus was immigration. ""60 Minutes"" just ran a segment on illegal aliens using TikTok for a step-by-step guide on where and how to enter the country illegally. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott deployed his state's National Guard to defend its border. Several migrants beat up NYPD cops. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who once brazenly said, ""our borders are not open,"" barely dodged impeachment. And now, even Sharpton calls the unprecedented number of illegal entries an ""invasion."" Is Trump still a ""racist""?

"January 26, 2024",Universal and Jordan Peele Board Dev Patel's 'Monkey Man' for April Release in Theaters,280,"  Jordan Peele and Universal have come aboard to release Dev Patel's directorial debut, Monkey Man. The completed action-thriller - which was previously set up at Netflix - will hit cinemas April 4, Peele revealed Friday when introducing the first official trailer. Insiders say Peele had a chance to see the movie, and was so taken with Patel's vision that he believed it deserved a theatrical release. Universal will market and distribute Monkey Man through its feature film deal with Peele's Monkeypaw banner. The film has been described as akin to John Wick in Mumbai.  ?? pic.twitter.com/iG9oLeXNaJ - Jordan Peele (@JordanPeele) January 26, 2024 In addition to directing, Patel also stars in the film, which is inspired by the legend of Hanuman, an icon embodying strength and courage. Patel plays Kid, an anonymous young man who ekes out a meager living in an underground fight club where, night after night, wearing a gorilla mask, he is beaten bloody by more popular fighters for cash. Ultimately, he sets out on a quest for vengeance against the corrupt leaders who murdered his mother and continue to systemically victimize the poor and powerless. Patel shot the film in Mumbai. The international cast includes Sharlto Copley, Sobhita Dhulipala, Pitobash, Vipin Sharma, Ashwini Kalsekar, Adithi Kalkunte, Sikandar Kher and Makarand Deshpande. Netflix reportedly acquired rights to Monkey Man in spring 2021 for around $30 million, but the status of that deal is unclear. Sources say Netflix wanted global rights, but that some international territories may have already been sold. Monkey Man is produced by Patel, Jomon Thomas, Peele, Win Rosenfeld, Ian Cooper, Basil Iwanyk, Erica Lee, Christine Haebler and Anjay Nagpal. More to come.

"February 20, 2024",Universal Music Takes Stake In Major Artist Catalog Firm For $240M,281,"  Universal Music Group has paid $240 million for a minority stake in Chord Music Partners, the music IP company launched by KKR and Dundee Partners in 2021. The major music label has picked up a 25.8 percent interest in a venture that has music catalogs belonging to The Weeknd, John Legend, Ryan Tedder/OneRepublic, David Guetta, Lorde, Kid Cudi, Diplo, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Ellie Goulding, ZZ Top and Twenty One Pilots. In all, Chord holds the rights to around 60,000 songs. The stake deal values the company at $1.85 billion, and includes KKR cashing out of Chord when the transaction is completed. At that point, the Dundee consortium and UMG will hold 74.2 percent and 25.8 percent stakes, respectively.  UMG and Dundee Partners will also strike a new strategic partnership to manage Chord's rights and to jointly acquire additional catalogs in the future. Chord's music publishing rights will be run through the Universal Music Publishing Group and recorded music through UMG's Virgin Music Group. ""Finding partners who share our passion for identifying iconic songs and recordings that will stand the test of time and deliver long-term growth is essential, which is why we're so pleased to be working with Stephen and Sam Hendel and Dundee Partners,"" Lucian Grainge, UMG chairman and CEO, said in a statement.

"November 8, 2023",USA Today's Front-Page Lashing of Libs of TikTok,282,"  They still call their national newspaper ""USA Today,"" but on some days, the front page looks more like ""LGBTQIA Today."" On Oct. 6, the bold top headline was ""When Libs of TikTok posts, threats increasingly follow."" The author is Will Carless, whose beat is ""extremism."" Beware, that beat is almost always just ""right-wing extremism."" That's how they define the wildly successful Twitter account of Libs of TikTok, operated by Chaya Raichik. In a front-page text box, USA Today warned this account is a ""creator of, and a force multiplier for, right-wing outrage."" It's a ""hive of conservative politicians, media personalities and far-right online influencers."" With badly disguised propaganda like this story, that can be reversed: USA Today is a creator of, and a force multiplier for, left-wing outrage. Carless came to the ""hive"" of McPaper from the far-left Center for Investigative Reporting. This new Carless front-pager spread to an entire inside page. It began with a list of alleged bomb threats and public ridicule of drag-queen events and hospitals performing mutilations, which they call ""gender-affirming care."" Then they blamed Libs of TikTok. ""In almost every case, the perpetrator of the threat is unknown, and Chaya Raichik, the far-right influencer who runs Libs of TikTok, says she opposes violence, and that because there have been almost no arrests, there's no proof the threats come from her followers,"" Carless admitted. But he warned of a ""clear pattern:"": ""USA Today has confirmed dozens of bomb threats, death threats and other harassment after Libs of TikTok's posts since February 2022."" Based on what? ""Exclusive new research from the progressive analysis group Media Matters for America."" So USA Today is partnering with a passionate LGBT advocacy group, not unlike the media's public alliance with the censorship group GLAAD. The method is the same: suggest that anyone and everyone who spreads information resisting their revolution is an extremist that spurs violence. It's meant to ruin reputations and intimidate people into silence. Anyone who calls in a bomb threat to anyone, even if they have no intention of acting on it, is committing a crime. That's why they're usually anonymous. But sometimes bomb threats are faked by the ""victims,"" just like Jussie Smollett faked a late-night beating by Trump fans. ""Extremism"" reporters like Carless are hot to find the ""far-right"" threats and ignore the behavior of their side. Speaking of extremism, Carless used experts like MMFA's Ari Drennen, who recently tweeted, ""homeschooling should be illegal. Too many parents use it to abuse their children, keeping them ignorant and easy to control."" Wow. That's just like The Washington Post, which once described right-wing Christians in a 1993 front-page article as ""largely poor, uneducated, and easy to command."" Carless also quoted Alejandra Caraballo, ""a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School Cyberlaw Clinic."" He noted Caraballo was ""openly critical"" of Raichik, but not that Caraballo is a radical ""trans woman."" Last month, Caraballo attacked Elon Musk after headlines vanished in Twitter posts. ""Elon Musk was arrested after being found in the street in a ketamine induced fugue state,"" she messaged. That was a lie. Then came a much worse lie: a retweet of another account claiming ""evidence showing Elon Musk is a pedophile mounting quickly."" Chaya Raichik tweeted, ""This is the person that the media cites as an 'online safety expert'."" Musk tweeted emojis that Caraballo was ""bat [guano] crazy."" That context might have balanced the USA Today story a tad. Carless let Raichik defend herself, but nothing about this article was balanced or fair. It was designed to shame and degrade any resistance to the ""LGBTQIA Today"" agenda.

"January 11, 2024",Video shows knife-wielding woman in Santa Rosa police lobby hours before stabbing death of her mother,283,"  Jan. 11—A Marin County woman who police say streamed live video of herself stabbing her mother to death Monday can be seen in a TikTok video, recorded a few hours before the slaying, in the lobby of the Santa Rosa Police Department holding a knife. Tonantzyn Oris Beltran, 28, a San Rafael resident, had been arrested early the previous morning, about 2:25 a.m. Sunday, by Santa Rosa police after a vehicle pursuit. In the 10-minute video she took around 1:30 p.m. Monday, according to Santa Rosa police, Beltran used her cellphone to record her mother talking to a police officer inside the lobby at the department's Sonoma Avenue headquarters. They'd come to reclaim Beltran's car, which police had impounded the previous day. A little over a minute into the video, she turns the camera away from the officer and her mother, and toward herself. Beltran can then be seen momentarily holding a knife in her left hand, while talking into the camera. Her coat is draped over her left forearm. Within about three minutes, the officer finishes talking to Beltran's mother — without noticing the knife Beltran was holding, according to the police department. After the 4 1/2 -minute mark, Beltran gets into the passenger seat of her mother's car. Taking her seat, the daughter says, ""You have no idea what's waiting for you."" Hours later, just before 5 p.m. Monday, San Rafael police responded to a report of a fight and possible stabbing in progress at an apartment complex on Cresta Way, where Beltran's mother lived. This device is unable to display framed content. Click here to view this embed. Upon arriving, officers were directed to an apartment's rear balcony. There, ""they saw Beltran on a balcony holding a knife in her hand, standing next to a stabbed female victim, and her clothes soaked in blood,"" said the statement. ""Beltran was not readily responsive to officers' commands and directions."" The woman, later identified by the Marin County coroner as 55-year-old Olivia Lucia Beltran Pacheco, was pronounced dead a short time after being transported to a hospital. While police were confronting Beltran from the balcony, another team of officers forced entry through the front door of the apartment and took her into custody, the report said. During the investigation, according to San Rafael police, it was learned that the incident had been broadcast by Beltran via Facebook Live. Detectives worked with Facebook's parent company, Meta, and had the video taken down. SAN RAFAEL WOMAN ARRESTED FOR HOMICIDE: On Monday, January 8, 2024, SRPD Officers and SRFD Paramedics rushed to a... Posted by San Rafael Police Department on Tuesday, January 9, 2024 Initial calls of the incident came from both witnesses at the scene and those who viewed the Facebook Live video. Around 2:25 a.m. Sunday morning, the day before the stabbing, Beltran was arrested by Santa Rosa police for a felony vehicle pursuit, said Sgt. Patricia Seffens, a spokesperson for the agency. She was booked into jail shortly after her arrest and was released on bail at about 11:15 a.m. Sunday, Seffens said. On Monday, Beltran and her mother were meeting with a sergeant regarding Beltran's car, which had been impounded following the vehicle pursuit. Part of that interaction is what's seen in the TikTok video. The recorded portion inside the lobby lasted no more than 4 minutes as Beltran's mother assured the sergeant that her daughter would not be driving the impounded car. During their discussion, Beltran turned her phone's camera on herself and flashed the knife with a 3-4-inch blade in her left hand. Seffens said ""it is not believed the sergeant or any other SRPD personnel were aware Beltran was in possession of the knife."" ""There are many variables to consider when reviewing this video, and any contacts between people and law enforcement officers, such as distance between parties, surrounding environment, angles, and the field of vision of the officer at the time of any incident,"" Seffens said. ""Images and videos captured by cameras may not accurately depict what can be seen by other people."" The recorded interaction in the police lobby begins with the sergeant telling Beltran's mother, ""There is concern that your daughter can't safely drive right now. ""You obviously know her. She probably has some mental health issues, based on what you said. ""In her current state, I'm not totally comfortable with her driving,"" the unidentified sergeant is heard saying. When Beltran starts talking over her mother, the sergeant tells her, ""I'm talking to your mother. She actually is making sense."" Noticing the officer's sidearm, Beltran says, too quietly for the others to hear, ""Look at that nice pistol."" After reversing the camera to record herself, Beltran abruptly transitions to promoting an upcoming party ""which is going to be lit."" The knife is visible in her left hand for about 20 seconds during this segment. When she turns the camera back to her mother and the officer, they're concluding their business. Santa Rosa police became aware of the video around 3 p.m. Wednesday, said Seffens. Asked if Beltran's erratic behavior might have raised red flags for the sergeant, Seffens replied that the video ""was reviewed by department leadership, and the sergeant's actions were not deemed to be improper, nor did they violate department policy, therefore a formal personnel inquiry is not warranted."" ""With the ongoing criminal investigation in San Rafael, I will not be able to answer any questions related to Beltran's mental health,"" she said. After the sergeant made his exit, Beltran is shown on video keeping up a stream of nonlinear chatter as she leaves the station with her mother. At one point her mother asks her to stop videotaping strangers. In the car, her mother calls a man, asking him to meet them at the towing company. As they turn left onto Sonoma Avenue, her mother's dreamcatcher dangling from the rearview mirror, the Eagles song ""Heartache Tonight"" comes on the radio. In another short TikTok video posted the same day, Beltran wields what looks to be the same knife before the camera. It was unknown Thursday whether it was the knife used in the stabbing. Olivia Beltran Pacheco was described in the Marin Independent Journal as a community activist who assisted immigrants and residents in San Rafael's Canal neighborhood. In addition to working as an outreach coordinator and bilingual associate director at the Canal Welcome Center, she was an organizer for the Grassroots Leadership Network of Marin. Her daughter, then 27, wrote about her past experience with substance abuse and mental health struggles in blog posted on Alex4Hope, where she said she began drinking at a young age. ""When I wasn't using, I became super anxious, super depressed or just not happy,"" she wrote. In the latest TikTok video posted to Beltran's account, she sits in a parked car with her mother, who tearfully refers to past abuses suffered by the daughter. ""Don't hurt yourself, daughter,"" the mother says. ""I don't I want you to end up in jail."" Later in the video, the mother pleads with Beltran to ""just calm down, and stay grounded. And work on yourself, and rest. ""You've gotta stop hurting yourself, and putting yourself in harm's way, you hear me? ""You are not to be going out with people you don't know. You've got to be safe."" Beltran is being held in Marin County jail without bail. At her first court appearance Thursday in the homicide case, her arraignment was delayed until Feb. 2.

"April 9, 2024",We Found The Best 7 Period Panties for Teens For A Leakproof Wear Starting at $10,285,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. While it's been years since I was a teenager, I do remember how rough it was - especially when it came to my menstrual cycle. Back in those days, there were really only two products for protection against your time of the month: pads and tampons. And let me remind you that often, these two were either super uncomfortable to insert or felt like you were wearing a downright diaper. But now, there are a slew of products, from organic tampons that are so sleek and feel like nothing to menstrual cups and period panties, making going through your cycle a bit more bearable. And speaking of period panties, in my opinion, there are some of the best protection options out there, especially for teens.  You see, the best period panties for tweens and teens can take the hassle out of constantly having to change feminine hygiene products throughout the day. As a young person who likely spends most of their time at school, remembering and keeping track of changing your pad or tampon every hour or so can be a lot. And considering how irregular periods can be at that age, wearing period panties can help stop those traumatic moments of bleeding through your clothes during class (ugh, how I hated that).  Best Period Panties for Teens at a Glance Most Affordable Period Panties for Tweens: Hanes Girls' Comfort Period Underwear 4-Pack, $10Best Seamless Period Panties for Teens: Leak Proof UltraThin No-Show Underwear Bikini, $22Best Sleep Period Panties for Teens: Thinx Sleep Shorts, $50Best Size-Inclusive Period Panties for Teens: TomboyX First Line Stretch Cotton Period 9-Inch Boxer Briefs, $26 Now, I know what you're thinking: can period panties really replace a trusted pad or tampon? Well, actually, yes. These days, period panties come with different absorbency levels that can hold just as much as a regular pad. But don't take our word for it. We chatted with Dr. Karyn Eilber, Uurogynecologist, Femetry Advisor, and co-uuthor of A Woman's Guide to Her Pelvic Floor: What the F*@# is Going On Down There, to talk about all things period underwear. Find out what she has to say and shop our favorite period panties for teens below now. What exactly are period panties? Period panties are underwear with a crotch made of a special lining that absorbs liquids,"" Dr. Eilber shared with SheKnows. The material in the crotch absorbs moisture like a menstrual pad, but unlike pads, they are reusable."" Most often, they're made of cotton, nylon, or spandex. Dr. Eilber recommends that, like any panty, ""mainly the crotch panel should be [made of] cotton."" What are the pros and cons of using period panties?  Dr. Eilber mentions that period panties are great from an environmental and economic standpoint since they're reusable. Unlike traditional one-time-use hygiene products, you can wash and rewash period underwear over and over again, so you don't have to spend as much money on pads or tampons as possible.  However, that is one of the downsides to them as well. If you or your teen is looking strictly to go the reusable route, you're going to need multiple pairs of period underwear to last through your cycle. ""You'll have to have enough panties to change them when full and last between washings,"" Dr Eilber says. ""If you're out, you also have to have a place to store the used panties."" Another thing Dr. Eilber says is to consider your flow. ""If your flow is extremely heavy, the panties may not prevent leaks,"" she says.

"April 2, 2024",We Found the Prettiest Floral Picnic-Style Dresses That Are *Actually* Nice for Prom,287,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. If you've been privy to all things prom lately, you probably know about the discord around picnic dresses that's taken over TikTok. If not, the teenager in your life definitely does. But if it makes you feel better, I, too, only just found out as well. If you don't want to ask your teen, allow me to clue you in (that's what I'm here for, my dear friend). With prom season a little over a month away, there's tons of talk about what everyone will be wearing this year, and one trend that's made its way back from last year is cottage-core. But this time, Gen Z is taking it a step further (while some may say a step back) and going for a more casual route with picnic-style dresses. These dresses are usually just shy of being a typical sundress but with a little more oomph.  The days of bold colors, silky fabrics, and shiny embellishments seem long gone - though I don't want to believe that as someone who went to prom almost 10 years ago. And I'm not the only one! Plenty of millennials have chimed into the conversation about this new trend, hoping to persuade the younger generation to go the more formal route, especially since prom is a rather formal event. If you feel like your teen falls into this category and wants to wear something floral picnic-style-esque, but you would like to see them in something that's actually nice to wear to prom, I have just the thing.  Introducing Milla Nova, a bridal company that makes some of the most lavish haute couture-style dresses for a fraction of the price.

"March 29, 2024",We're Learning Just How Bad Smartphones Are for Our Kids - But What If Yours Already Has One?,289,"  If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SheKnows may receive an affiliate commission. If you're a parent scrolling through your socials, you've probably seen Jonathan Haidt's new book The Anxious Generation - because it's everywhere. Released just this week, it's already an Amazon bestseller, and it is raising red flags about an issue that's becoming more and more disturbing the more we learn about it: the toll that social media is taking on our kids' mental health. The signs are becoming increasingly clear: the kids are not all right. In May of 2023, U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued an advisory on the subject.  ""The most common question parents ask me is, 'is social media safe for my kids'. The answer is that we don't have enough evidence to say it's safe, and in fact, there is growing evidence that social media use is associated with harm to young people's mental health,"" Murthy said. ""Children are exposed to harmful content on social media, ranging from violent and sexual content, to bullying and harassment. And for too many children, social media use is compromising their sleep and valuable in-person time with family and friends. We are in the middle of a national youth mental health crisis, and I am concerned that social media is an important driver of that crisis - one that we must urgently address."" A few statistics ... In January of this year, The New York Times reported on a survey by Common Sense Media, in which 65 percent of kids ages 12-17 felt that the mental health of the youth in their community was ""poor or fair."" Only one-third of respondents thought things were going well for kids and teens today. Less than half said they anticipated being better off than their parents someday.  A different study, published late last year by Gallup and the Walton Family Foundation, found that Gen Z'ers are a lot more likely to report feeling stress, anxiety, and loneliness. A mere 15 percent of people ages 18-26 said their mental health was excellent - which is in stark contrast to a similar study done a decade ago. When asked the same question back in 2014, 52 percent of millennials in the same age group reported that their mental health was excellent. Here's what you should know about the potential impact social media has on our teens' mental health. https://t.co/UjdIIWpHto - SheKnows (@SheKnows) May 29, 2023 Dr. Matthew Biel, chief of the division of child and adolescent psychiatry at Georgetown University Hospital, told the NYT that ""the digitization of our lives, and social media in particular,"" was a major factor in the decline of adolescent mental health. And in his book, Haidt examines just that: what has happened to the kids of the digital generation? Haidt chalks it up to a one-two punch of factors. First, the decline of the ""play-based childhood""; he says that parents, fueled by increasing fears about real-world safety (thanks, media), began to restrict kids' access to unsupervised outdoor free play. That coincided with the rise of the ""phone-based childhood"" - the dawn of the age of smartphones and social media platforms.  ""Few of us understood what was happening in children's virtual worlds and we lacked the knowledge to protect them from tech companies that had designed their products to be addictive,"" he writes on his website. ""For this reason, we ended up overprotecting children in the real world while underprotecting them in the virtual world.""  The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness Buy Now On Amazon $19.57 Even the youth themselves are reporting that there's a problem; according to Pew Research, almost a quarter of adolescents believe that social media has a mostly negative effect. Yet they have trouble staying away - in 2022, over half (54 percent) reported struggling to ""give up"" social media, and 36 percent admitted to spending ""excessive"" time on their platforms of choice.  We've seen this firsthand: Four years ago, SheKnows did a deep dive with our Hatch teens on this exact subject (and this was before the rise of TikTok!). As more and more parents start to wonder if they've failed their kids by giving them unfettered access to these smart devices (raises hand), parental stances on social media use are starting to pivot, and the pendulum is increasingly swinging toward more conservative use. The ""Wait Until 8th"" pledge, for example, is a movement that encourages parents to hold off on allowing smartphones until at least the eighth grade. (Haidt, based on his own research, recommends waiting until high school). Basic phones and watches with call and text capabilities are fine, they say - it's phones with social media access that should be off-limits.  ""Smartphones are distracting and potentially dangerous for children yet are widespread in elementary and middle school because of unrealistic social pressure and expectations to have one,"" the Wait Until 8th site says. ""These devices are quickly changing childhood for children. Playing outdoors, spending time with friends, reading books and hanging out with family is happening a lot less to make room for hours of Snapchatting, Instagramming, and catching up on YouTube."" What if my child already has a smartphone? Even if the damage is already done, and our pre-8th-grade kids already have smartphones, we can lessen their dependence on them by setting clear boundaries. Ariana Hoet, Ph.D., executive clinical director of children's mental health organization On Our Sleeves, told SheKnows that she recommends designated screen-free times every day: during dinner, for example, and powering phones down a couple of hours before bedtime. Additionally, she advises making a family social media plan.  ""You can talk about what social media platforms you're going to use. Who do you follow? What do you post? And then most importantly, when are the screen-free times? What are other activities you're doing? Who do you go to if you're worried about something?"" Dr. Hoet says. ""You also need to establish the consequences: what happens if these rules are broken?"" Adolescents these days are being raised largely by parents who didn't have this problem, so they're essentially the guinea pigs, or as Haidt calls them, the ""canaries in the coal mine."" They're the first generation to be fully immersed in a digital world at such a young age - but also the first to make us realize that, maybe, that isn't such a good idea after all.

"March 4, 2024","Westside woman is filmed making racist rant over dog; 'I reacted badly,' she says in apology after feud over leash laws becomes a viral video.",290,"  A Westside dispute between two women over an unleashed dog took on racist tones when one told the other to ""go back to China,"" according to a TikTok video that has generated more than 6 million views. A white woman, Denise Olin, was caught in the video hurling racially charged remarks during the Feb. 24 fight with her neighbor, who asked Olin to put her dog on a leash. Los Angeles laws require dogs to be on a leash on public property and common areas of private property. Olin has told The Times she regrets her comments. The two women, who appear to have a history of conflict, recorded each other during the encounter. ""Let me educate you,"" says the woman who posted the video to TikTok, identified through her account on the platform as Cindy. ""Let me educate you, go back to China,"" responds Olin, also recording the incident on her phone. ""I don't want your dog to get hurt,"" Cindy says. When Cindy calls Olin a ""Karen,"" Olin responds, ""You're an Asian Karen."" At another point, Olin repeatedly asks Cindy if she understands English. Olin claims in the video that Cindy once referred to her as a ""bitch"" and is the ""most hated woman on our block."" ""Everybody hates you,"" Olin says. Olin, who is Irish, also says Cindy had told her to go back to her country; Cindy denies this. The incident took place on Butler Avenue in Sawtelle. Olin apologized Thursday in a text message to The Times and said she has received death threats since the video was posted Monday on TikTok. ""I'm devastated and receiving so many death threats,"" Olin texted. ""The police are involved. I'm so sorry for what I said. I reacted badly. It was our second altercation and she had said similar stuff to me. I had not filmed it. There was no excuse for what I said. I'm so remorseful. I'm not a racist just stupid."" Olin shared with The Times a voicemail she had received in which the caller said they would have shot her in the face if she had made such comments to them. Cindy could not immediately be reached for comment. ""I am Asian, but I am not from China,"" Cindy wrote on her TikTok post. ""I am an immigrant, but my family and I have been living in America for more than 20 years. This is our home. It deeply hurts me that there are still people out there making such racist remarks."" The video is reminiscent of a 2020 incident in New York in which a white woman called police on a Black man after he asked her to put her dog on a leash. That woman, Amy Cooper, lost her job in the aftermath of a viral video of the encounter. ""Over three years later, I am still in hiding. I am scared to be in public,"" Cooper wrote in an op-ed last year.

"January 25, 2024",What Parents Need to Know About the 'Highly Addictive' Zyn Pouches Marketed Toward Teens,291,"  While your teen is shopping for Slurpees at your local 7-11, they may notice a new product by the cigarettes: Zyn nicotine pouches. These have been rising in popularity among teens and young adults, and if you think your kid is immune to the hype, think again. A SheKnows editor who had never heard of Zyn asked her high-school-aged sons about it, and they knew exactly what it was. Learn more about what these ""highly addictive"" products are, and how you can talk to your teens about them below.What is ZYN?Zyn nicotine pouches are part of a new trend of non-combustible products containing nicotine, such as electronic cigarettes and heat-not-burn products. They are little white pouches containing powdered nicotine that are supposed to be placed under your upper lip and in front of your gum, exactly like Swedish snus. You don't chew it like nicotine gum, and you don't have to spit like chewing tobacco, which makes it appealing (and easy to hide). Not to mention, many are flavored like candy, so it tastes much better than traditional tobacco products. According to the manufacturer, you can enjoy ""up to one hour of real nicotine satisfaction"" with each pouch, which comes in a can of 15 and is supposedly designed to help smokers quit. (Other similar brand names include Dryft, Loop, Lyft, Nordic Spirit, On!, Rouge, Rush, Velo, and ZoneX.) Although you must be at least 21 to purchase and consume a Zyn pouch legally, that hasn't stopped the product from getting aggressively promoted on TikTok, with videos of people trying them getting millions of views - and these videos are landing on the FYPs of teens who are too young to buy them. Zynfluencers You may not see ads for Zyn on TV or on billboards, but your kids are seeing them via social media influencers (or Zynfluencers) on TikTok. An 18-year-old Kansas-based high schooler recently told The New York Times that a ""lot of high schoolers have been using Zyn. It's really taken off, at least in our community."" Phillip Morris International, the parent company of Zyn, denies using influencers of any sort: ""Our marketing practices - which prohibit the use of social media influencers - are focused on preventing underage access and set the benchmark for the industry,"" a representative for the company wrote in a statement.  One 2023 study found that 21% of underage youth have used oral nicotine products (including Zyn) sometime in their lives.  According to the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA), Zyn and other brands of these nicotine pouches are not safe for teens and young adults. ""No tobacco product is safe,"" the FDA wrote in a statement. ""Young people have a higher risk of becoming addicted to the nicotine in tobacco products than adults because their brains are still developing. Nicotine exposure during adolescence can also disrupt normal brain development."" Calls for a Ban WASHINGTON, DC - JANUARY 23: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) speaks during a press conference following the Democrats weekly policy luncheon on January 23, 2024 in Washington, DC. Negotiations over border security, military aid to Ukraine and Israel, and the government budget continue this week on Capitol Hill. (Photo by Samuel Corum/Getty Images) Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer called on the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission to take action against Zyn's marketing products and health effects on Wednesday. ""Amid federal action against e-cigs and their grip on young people, a quiet and dangerous alternative has emerged and it is called Zyn,"" Schumer said in a statement, per USA Today. ""I am delivering a new warning to parents because these nicotine pouches seem to lock their sights on teens and use social media to hook them."" He added, ""The amount of nicotine is highly addictive and much more needs to be done to understand and communicate the health risks for young people."" Brian King, director of the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products told USA Today, ""The FDA remains concerned about any tobacco product that may appeal to youth. FDA uses a variety of surveillance tools to monitor the evolving tobacco product landscape and to identify emerging threats to public health."" How to Talk to Your Teen So what now? How do you talk to your teen about Zyn and - more importantly! - stop them from using it? The Partnership to End Addiction has several tips, paraphrased below:  Stay up to date on the latest trends in nicotine products, so you know what they look like and how they are used. Model healthy behavior by not using or condoning the use of any nicotine products.Have honest, regular conversations about nicotine, other substances, and their health risks. Convey that you expect them not to use these products and will be monitoring their activities and intervening when necessary, in a health-promoting way. Be open and let your kids know they can come to you for help if they are struggling and possibly using nicotine or other substances to cope.Know about the factors that can increase your child's risk of using nicotine products, such as mental health issues, and address these early with the help of a qualified health professional. If you suspect your child is using Zyn nicotine pouches or other addictive substances, call the Partnership to End Addiction's free helpline at 855-378-4373 or visit their website for more resources HERE.

Attention all my fellow Amazon shoppers, there's a huge sale happening this week - and no, it's not Prime Day. However, it does have us wondering when Prime Day 2024 is going to happen.

Typically, Amazon Prime Day and all their incredible deals are for Prime members only, however, the Big Spring Sale is open to everyone. No membership required.

"March 11, 2024","When it comes to ketamine, Meta’s posting policy is no party to decipher",293,"  People keep talking about ketamine. The drug has become a favorite of celebrities, billionaires, and ordinary patients, many of whom view it as a potential miracle drug for depression and other mental health conditions. Whether on Facebook or Instagram, patients and clinics alike are giddy about the possibilities. But it is a drug that can be abused and can be deadly. Thus, ketamine is the latest challenge for Meta, the social media platforms’ parent company, which for years has struggled to moderate posts and ads touting health-related products like weight loss supplements and dodgy covid-19 cures. Still, despite warnings about the drug’s dangers, Meta allows ads and posts about ketamine. Sometimes that chatter comes from sources that don’t meet the conglomerate’s voluminous standards, which, in theory, ensure posts are based on credible information. Other internet ad networks are also trying to strike balances. Google says that because ketamine is a prescription drug, it can be advertised only if a provider is offering a prescription and is certified with a third-party oversight group; advertisers can’t promote “highs.” TikTok, which didn’t reply to a request for comment, broadly prohibits advertising from unauthorized pharmacies or dispensaries, or advertising that features prescription drug abuse. Meta’s rules have created a conundrum for the company. Posts about ketamine, both a party drug and a possible mental health therapeutic, are governed by very different rules depending on the context, according to an investigation and report by the company’s outside Oversight Board, an organization dubbed Facebook’s “Supreme Court” for its role in refereeing the platform’s speech regulations. That balancing act was on public display after a post about the substance was inspected repeatedly by the company’s content review bureaucracy. When asked to comment for this article, Meta simply referred KFF Health News to the board’s report and the company’s reply to the report. This back-and-forth dates to December 2022, when a paid influencer posted on Instagram how the drug eased the influencer’s “treatment-resistant depression and anxiety.” The post described a “magical entry into another dimension.” After reviewing the paid post and Meta’s rules on drug promotion, the Oversight Board found that the post inappropriately hyped the high of the drug, while not placing it in a medical context — a problem, given the tension in the company’s rules allowing discussion of pharmaceutical products and disallowing references to illicit drug use. Ketamine, which is available in both liquid and powder form, emerged first as an anesthetic and became popular as a party drug because of its dissociative and hallucinogenic effects. It’s FDA-approved as an anesthetic and, in some formulations, as a prescription antidepressant, to be administered in medically supervised settings. Regulated as a Schedule 3, nonnarcotic substance under the Controlled Substances Act, the drug has been shown to cause dependence, especially for people with a history of addiction to other substances. But researchers are intrigued by another aspect of ketamine: its mind-altering properties, which have potential therapeutic benefits. These possibilities, aided by a boom in ketamine-focused medical startups and spas promoting the prescription drug as part of “holistic healing” or other wellness purposes, are fueling consumer interest, news coverage, and social media attention. But there are indications of a dark side. According to an autopsy report from Los Angeles County’s medical examiner department, actor Matthew Perry died with ketamine in his system as he reportedly was undergoing infusion therapy meant to treat depression and anxiety. Poison center reports of exposures involving ketamine surged just over 80% from 2019 through 2021, a study showed. The tug of war is leading to conflicts between social media giants and advertisers. While Meta and its peers sometimes allow posts on the drug, they also include warnings. For example, if you search Instagram for “ketamine,” you learn the term “may be associated with the sale of drugs” and are offered a button to “get help” for substance abuse treatment. (You can also opt to get the results anyway.) In 2023, hoping to resolve the situation, Meta referred the controversy concerning the post to its Oversight Board. The group has received $280 million in irrevocable funding since 2019. Membership includes former heads of state, prominent journalists, and human rights advocates. For the “magical entry” post, according to a Meta missive cited in the board’s report, the company expected the board would agree and open its platforms to more posting about mind-altering drugs with therapeutic potential. But the board instead offered pointed critiques and questions, threatening the status of other ketamine posts. The board argued that, based on the company’s policies, the post inappropriately made ketamine seem like a “high,” rather than a medical experience. “This case indicates that Meta’s strong restrictions on branded content promoting drugs and attempts to buy, sell, or trade drugs may be inconsistently enforced,” the board concluded in its report. Indeed, in a comment to the board, the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy suggested it’s easy to find sellers offering the drug for recreational use, citing two clear examples found “with only a cursory search.” The company’s executives disagreed. When presenting the controversy to the board, they said they expected medical use of ketamine to increase, so it should allow the post. That led, in its response, to the company brushing off some of the board’s suggestions, which could directly impact ketamine clinics’ profits. After all, Facebook and Instagram audiences overlap with their clientele, and these ads are one of the main ways they promote their brands. Consider the money at stake. One recent academic review of ketamine clinics’ advertising online, which was published in JAMA Network Open, found prices ranging from $360 to $2,500 per infusion. When a particularly influential influencer posts about his clinic, there’s “a sharp uptick” in interest “every single time,” Jacob Silverstone, the medical director of a ketamine infusion clinic outside Miami, told KFF Health News. That interest often drives patients to his clinic, he said. Still, despite the social media buzz, evidence for ketamine as a mental health treatment is unsettled. “Data from clinics strongly suggest that there’s a benefit” from the drug, said Boris Heifets, a Stanford University School of Medicine professor of anesthesiology studying ketamine and other psychiatric therapies like MDMA. Ketamine, some of these studies indicate, can work for depression — even for patients who don’t respond to conventional treatments like SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. But, Heifets said, pop culture oversells the potential. On social media, some clinics promote practices without scientific backing, he said. “It’s not clear that they have any mental health expertise,” he said. Some clinic ads he has seen, Heifets said, dwell on the idea that the drugs act quickly and comprehensively — avoiding the lack of good data about long-term therapeutic use. The review of ketamine clinics’ claims in ads on Google found the businesses rarely disclosed potential side effects, while aggressively marketing its benefits. Some ads falsely claimed the drug is nonaddictive, the review said. Facebook and Instagram advertising can be similarly bullish about ketamine’s potential. A fall 2023 search of Meta’s ad library shows an armada of ketamine clinics with sunny claims, some promising “rapid relief” or telling viewers they can “say goodbye to a once-daily SSRI” or that “IV ketamine can be your light in the darkness.” These types of claims, while downplaying risks like substance use disorders, create outsize expectations in patients, Heifets said. “You can create expectations for some of these kind of big interventions that if they’re not met — that can actually be disastrous for patients.” The ads making such claims and minimizing or not mentioning the risks often appear to be slipping through a system with inconsistent regulations, and puzzling gaps, a review by KFF Health News suggests. Meta’s policies require many advertisers who offer prescription drugs, and all advertisers offering drug and addiction treatment services, to undergo additional vetting by a group called LegitScript before they’re allowed to hawk their wares or services on Facebook and Instagram. (Google similarly requires certification from an outside body like LegitScript for online pharmacies, telemedicine, and addiction services.) LegitScript reviews the advertisers’ operations, like their clinical leadership and partnerships with pharmacies. But in practice, ketamine advertisers often don’t go through this process even if they fall into a category that should. KFF Health News reviewed 27 advertisers on Meta in October and November 2023. Of those, 10 advertisers, spread over both months, either offered ketamine for drug addiction or ketamine via telehealth, and were not registered with LegitScript. The online ads promote services, generally via telehealth, that prescribe ketamine — often in a lozenge prepared by a compounding pharmacy. There’s much less evidence for the safety and effectiveness of oral ketamine, Heifets said, compared with that of intravenously administered ketamine, which is more often studied. Enforcement is on Meta’s agenda. In its response to the Oversight Board on the ketamine case, Meta said it has improved its automated review tools for some advertisements promoting drugs, and pledged to consider auditing its policies in the first half of this year. Federal regulators are showing signs of concern about ketamine, particularly when obtained online. Last year, the Drug Enforcement Administration shut down the telehealth practice of at least one physician who prescribed ketamine nationwide. In October 2023, the FDA issued a warning about compounded ketamine — which these telehealth startups tend to rely on, Silverstone said. ___ (KFF Health News, formerly known as Kaiser Health News (KHN), is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs of KFF — the independent source for health policy research, polling and journalism.) ©2024 KFF Health News.

Not only do they have a good selection of options, their prices are also some of the lowest out there, especially if the Squishmallows are sold and shipped by Amazon. Now, if you're looking for any of the collabs like Disney, Harry Potter, Pokémon, or Sanrio, BoxLunch and Hot Topic are your best bet. Both brands have sales all the time and even have special variations that you can't find anywhere else.  One of my favorite places to snag a Squishmallow? Costco. Truth be told, I wasn't really a big plushie fan until I came across their jumbo 20-inch Hello Kitty Squishmallows. To this day, I still think my plushie is huge. But apparently, Costco now has even BIGGER Squishmallows - I'm talking sizes about two feet tall! Even TikTok is obsessed at how giant these things are.

"October 23, 2023",Who's behind the 'sassy man apocalypse' taking over TikTok?,295,"  Prayag Mishra didn't ask to be sassy. It's just who he is. ""I really don't know how to feel about this whole sassy thing and I wanted to talk about it,"" Mishra, a TikTok creator, said in a recent viral video. ""First thing I want to say is guilt, guilty, guilty. I've been that."" Mishra's videos have reached the For You page of over a million people (at least), winning them over with his charm and unapologetic attitude. He's been dubbed a proponent of the ""sassy man apocalypse,"" part of an online trend showing men unafraid to say it how it is, while wearing their emotions on their sleeves. Trending TikTok videos of the sassy man apocalypse include men clapping back to insults and embracing self-expression, no matter how feminine their popped hip may seem to detractors. At the movement's core is a disruption of gender norms, and Mishra is aware of the ability it has to break down stereotypes. The video that put the Toronto-based creator on the map was his dance tutorial of the ""Wassup Gway"" trend where he adds a shoulder push, while quipping: ""It's the way you act, act, act, act."" The snippet has been replicated across social media with captions like ""When your manager asks why you're putting in your 2 weeks"" and ""When my mom asks why I don't live at home to save money."" Mishra has grown his ""pookie nation"" to over a million followers for embracing his inner sassy man. Here's what the latest leader of the ""sassy man apocalypse"" has to say about how his new role has altered his perspective on life. This interview has been edited for clarity and length. On Sept.27, you were celebrating 100,000 followers and 11 days later you were celebrating a million. How doesit feel to witness that rise? It's definitely a very surreal feeling. I'm now experiencing a lot of people coming up to me in real life, everywhere I go - people on the road will wave to me. It's just very, very surreal because it's always just been me and my phone. To have a real-life impact is unbelievable. There are thousands of mentions and duets that I can't even catch up on. It's been a beautiful, beautiful feeling. When did you realize that what you were creating resonated with people and was going to be something big? When I started getting DMs and a lot of messages expressing how it's actually helping them understand how important radical acceptance and self-expression actually are. A month ago, it was the first time that I was putting all of myself on the internet. When I made the video saying, ""Guilty, guilty. I'm sassy."" I really wasn't expecting love. I was expecting more of a divide. I was expecting to be made fun of or roasted. I've always been this way my entire life, so to get unanimous love from the people is one of the biggest blessings. What originally brought you to TikTok? I was 23 years old when I started posting. Over the years, I can see my progression as becoming more and more of who I am on the internet. So when you first start, you're acting a certain way, you're talking a certain way, you're trying to deepen your voice, you're trying to sound a bit more sophisticated, you're trying to sound a bit more intelligent. Over time, my ego started to fall a little bit and my guard started to get let down. Something just clicked in me where I said, ""It's go time. You have to just show the world who you are."" And it's been unbelievable to see people responding to that.  Your content really aligns with the ""sassy man apocalypse."" How would you say you fit into that movement? I've always been called sassy my entire life. In terms of where I fit into the movement, I'm on the front lines of the sassy man apocalypse. There are great sassy men that came before me and there are great sassy men around me now. And the idea is that a sassy man is someone who is confident. I don't think it's for everyone. I think it's only for people who have tapped into self-expression and accept themselves first and foremost. To be sassy to me is to be comedic, to be funny, to talk back, to tell people how you really feel, to dive into a type of self-expression that isn't bound by traditional masculine, macho norms. I think that the rise of the sassy man is well due and I'm glad to be a part of it. Who is your sassy man inspiration? Drake is thesassy man apocalypse leader right now. I definitely think he's up there. He's always been himself in terms of his expression. He's not scared to be considered less manly by any means. How has TikTok altered your life? I've always been in tech, that's been the industry I've always worked in. I got fired from my job last year, and I started expressing myself online since then. I don't think that there's any capacity in which It hasn't changed my life. It's truthfully come to the point where it's taken over. I believe that the only way forward is for me to express myself and honor exactly who I am at that point in time. I can always yearn for people's love. I will always appreciate it. But this is truthfully all happening because of the people. Not because of me. The love and the pookie bears - the pookie nation. What do you hope for the future of your time on TikTok and for the 'sassy man apocalypse'? I desperately want to create a massive impact in the way that online culture has come about. I think for the longest time, the online world has been a bit of a war zone, the wild, wild west. The amount of negativity and hate that spread online is unbelievable. I speak in the language of love and romance. My mission here is to help people understand that we can actually practice love with one another every single day and change the way that we speak to one another. We do not have to be bound by social norms. We do not have to be bound by gender norms. We can be who we are, we can love each other we can we can accept each other.

"January 26, 2024",Why I'm Not Letting My Daughter Raid My Drunk Elephant,296,"  My daughter asked for three things for Chanukah this year: clothes, books, and skincare - and yes, a skincare fridge to keep said skincare in. The clothes and books were an easy ""yes"" - they were totally appropriate requests for a teenage girl. But the skincare ... something about the products she asked for and the reason she was asking for those products made me uneasy. She wanted products from Drunk Elephant, Glow Recipe, and other trendy brands that line the walls of Sephora's shelves - and also take up space in my bathroom cabinet. She wanted them to make her skin brighter and smoother, to tone her skin, hydrate it, and keep it young. The glaring problem? Her skin is already bright and smooth. Her skin is already hydrated and young. The products she wanted are full of ingredients - many of which I didn't recognize and couldn't pronounce - that promised to address issues her youthful skin didn't have. And if the products weren't actually addressing issues, they were either doing nothing (in which case, why spend so money on those expensive products?) or they were causing harm. From @selenagomez's @rarebeauty to Unicorn Glow, these are some of the best teen-approved makeup brands you have to check out. https://t.co/1qzwIgUvRB - SheKnows (@SheKnows) June 29, 2022 Brooke Jeffy, MD, a board-certified dermatologist and founder of youth skincare brand BTWN, confirmed my assumption. In an email to SheKnows, she noted that most of the currently trending products are aimed for problems kids don't have - like sunspots and wrinkles. ""This leads to a situation of all risk with no benefit when kids use products for adults. Our skin is an organ, not a wall, and what we apply to it influences its functions and may actually cause more problems with skin allergy and sun damage in the future."" Specifically, she noted that products whose active ingredients include retinol, vitamin C, and exfoliating acids are not appropriate for young skin, which tends to be more sensitive. According to Dr. Jeffy, ""Use of inappropriate products that are too harsh for younger skin damages the skin's ability to do its jobs of keeping moisture in, infections out, and protecting us from environmental damage like ultraviolet light exposure."" My daughter balked when I told her I had reservations, that I thought the products were a waste of money or not appropriate for her. After all, everyone was using these products. All her friends were allowed to use these products. Why was I being so unfair? The questions led me to the other reason I hesitated to say yes to her skincare wish list. I didn't want her to buy into an expensive trend just because she saw something on social media. I didn't want her to make decisions about her body, her skin - the largest organ in her body - based on a ""Get Ready With Me"" (GRWM) video filmed by other kids, often celebrity kids. Filmed by kids who were mimicking the GRWM videos filmed by adults. You only get one body, and I don't want her to think it's okay to make choices about what she puts on or in her body based exclusively on what ""everyone"" is doing or what social media tells her is trendy. Or because she's buying into the idea that something about her needs fixing, that somehow these products will help her reach some unrealistic and unattainable standard pushed by the beauty industry, which is trying to turn a profit from a new consumer base. Nicholette Leanza, psychotherapist, LPCC-S, of LifeStance Health, told SheKnows that the recent skincare craze among tweens and teens probably stems from the beauty industry, ""which perpetuates unrealistic beauty standards"" and is motivated, no doubt, by the idea of turning a profit from a brand new customer base. A customer base that they can easily reach, for the first time ever, thanks to social media. Twenty-ish years ago (okay, maybe more) I remember flipping through teen magazines and wondering why I didn't look like the girls on the pages, and believing that I could look like that if I had whatever product on the ad page. That feeling must be amplified by a thousand for our kids. They are the ""first generation that's really grown up in this digital age where TikTok and Youtube have replaced linear TV. So they're getting all this information because media agencies can target them easily,"" board-certified dermatologist Dr. Marnie Nussbaum noted on The Today Show. More information, more ads, more pressure to look a certain way. It's a lot for a young teen/tween; actually, it's a lot for adults, too. And it's hard enough to be a teen girl that I didn't want my daughter to be alienated if everyone was going to Sephora - emphasis hers, not mine. I also know that if she really wants skincare, she'll find a way to get it. I did when I was her age and sneakily applying my mom's blush before school. Which is why we opted for a compromise. No, she can't raid my Drunk Elephant and she can't go into Sephora and buy whatever product she saw on TikTok (have you seen some of these adolescent skincare and makeup hauls?! Outrageous!). But she can develop a healthy skincare regimen, one based on products she actually needs: specifically a cleanser, a moisturizer, and something for sun protection, all made for normal to sensitive skin. And she can go into Sephora and shop and enjoy the experience, while holding onto the truth that happiness isn't going to be found in a serum - and her self-worth can't be defined by a lotion. As for the skincare fridge, well ... as with almost everything when it comes to parenting, there's a balance-and when it's harmless, it's fun to just say yes.

"December 3, 2023",Why TikTok is dangerously good at making you spend money,297,"  As I was scrolling through TikTok the other day, I received a text from a friend. ""I take back everything bad I said about TikTok Shop,"" she said. ""I just bought a Staub Dutch oven for like $100. And it's normally like $400."" I had no idea what a Dutch oven is used for, but I thought I might need one too. I mean, I had to at least check - the deal was too good to be true. Thankfully, I came to my senses and did not buy one. But I did spend almost $100 on other items from TikTok Shop that day. Ever since TikTok officially launched its in-app shopping feature in the U.S. in September, it's quickly turned the video-scrolling app into a budding e-commerce marketplace. The new feature sells about $7 million worth of products a day in the U.S., with a goal of reaching $10 million a day by the end of the year, the Wall Street Journal reported last month. Although TikTok Shop has a ways to go before it can truly match up to the likes of e-commerce giant Amazon in terms of sheer volume, customer trust and delivery logistics, what it does have is unparalleled command over eyeballs. TikTok has 150 million users in the U.S., 35% of whom are ages 18 to 24. Teens in particular spend an average of nearly two hours a day on the app. And TikTok Shop is proving to be remarkably effective at turning that screen time into shopping time. Psychological warfare It's impossible to spend any amount of time on TikTok these days without encountering an ad or a video that has a product linked for commission. And not just any product. I routinely see the same slew of items - specifically targeted to blend into my feed of fashion, mental health and art content - over, and over, and over again until I could practically market them myself. A brown faux leather shoulder bag, big enough to carry someone's laptop, a few books, phone, wallet. The Beachwaver, a rotating curling iron that will curl your hair in minutes. A shadow work journal to help you heal your inner child. The OQQ three-piece women's body suit that will snatch your waist, even if you just gave birth. A 100-color watercolor set that comes with 35 metallic colors and three water brush pens. Repetition as a promotional strategy is nothing new, but on TikTok Shop it feels like a form of psychological warfare. I'm losing the battle - or at least my credit card is. This endless onslaught of product videos is being generated by a growing number of creators who almost exclusively focus on recommendation or review videos. They talk directly into the camera while unboxing or trying out a new product. They're chatty and affable, and they seem like regular people who are genuinely recommending something they've found useful or enjoyable in their everyday lives. Now one video on its own isn't going to persuade me to buy something, but scrolling through 10 or 20 videos featuring real-life testimonies about the same product might be enough to get me to cave. ""This is the toner that was ranked No. 1 in Korea for months and months and months and months,"" a woman tells me knowingly, her hair freshly wet from the shower and two white toner pad squares on her face. ""When I was in Korea I stocked up back in March."" She held up a bottle that I had already seen recommended by two other accounts. All three women had smooth, shiny plump skin - the kind of skin that stays tantalizingly out of reach for me. Los Angeles creator Dina Asprer said she doesn't consider herself an ""influencer"" or a ""TikTok person"" but had always been passionate about Korean skincare, having lived in Korea for five years after college. The 31-year-old quit her banking job during the pandemic to spend more time with her kids and only made TikToks for fun. She started putting links to products in her videos in June when the option became available to some users. One particular item took off - a snail mucin essence from popular Korean brand COSRX. At one point, she was earning commission from selling 600 bottles a day, and now still sells around 1,000 bottles a month. ""I never considered this as a job, but I'm starting to take it more seriously,"" Asprer said. She's even attended a few workshops that TikTok offers to help creators grow, traveling to its office in Culver City. In another video that pops up on my feed, a woman demands my attention. ""Listen to me,"" Katelyn Beaupre says urgently. ""If you have eczema or dry skin, I'm about to put you on."" I don't have either, but for some reason, this information feels important to know. Beaupre explains that she works at a daycare and has OCD, which means her hands are extremely dry from washing them frequently. Other products made her hands greasy, but this one - which she purchased after seeing it all over TikTok - was so good she was bringing it in for her co-workers to try. ""I was a little skeptical at first because I really didn't like the smell,"" Beaupre says. ""To me, it smells like oregano."" That video, featuring a lotion by the brand the Ocean Healed My Eczema, has 3.6 million views. She posted about it a few more times. Last month, she made about $20,000 in commissions. The 22-year-old from Massachusetts has a little more than 95,000 followers on TikTok and makes videos when she has time, outside of working at a preschool full time and going to school part time. But the commissions she's earned in the last two months has helped her to pay off her credit card debt and student loans. Commissions range from 20 cents to $7 a purchase and can fluctuate if a certain product, like the rotating curling iron for example, starts trending, leading to more influencers making videos about it, Beaupre noticed. ""Sometimes I try to go for things that are a little bit higher in commission,"" she said. She also indicates in her profile that she's a ""UGC + lifestyle creator,"" which means her videos are available for companies to use as user-generated content in paid TikTok ads. The eczema lotion that Beaupre promoted first offered a $4.99 commission, or 20% of the price, before lowering it to closer to $3. Maybe that's why there are countless other videos of creators raving about the very same product. Yet they still feel honest. People showed before-and-after pictures of their hands, legs and elbows, some using it for eczema and dry hands and others for psoriasis. The company has made it simple for sellers to make products eligible for commission and creators to request free products and post videos with a direct link to generate sales, streamlining a process that otherwise might have required more business-savvy from both sides. TikTok Shop has just two requirements for commission-eligible creators: you must be over 18 and have at least 5,000 followers. Gen Z's QVC shopping channel Every week, Brandon Hurst sells more than 1,200 plants from his 800-square-foot apartment in Van Nuys. He carefully packages each one - golden pothos, string of hearts, trailing hoya - with a small team of employees, slaps on a bright sticker that reads ""live plants,"" and ships them across the country. Then the next batch arrives at his apartment, ready to be sold. His secret? Live selling. Hurst makes a majority of his sales through TikTok live streams every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, when he greets loyal customers, welcomes newcomers and talks about the plants available in his shop. He joined TikTok Shop in April before its formal launch, and he's sold more than 30,000 plants since - more than the amount he sold in the three years before joining the platform. ""I try to turn it into kind of like a show, a little bit like QVC,"" Hurst said of his livestreams. ""Literally within the first five minutes, we already are at like 10 or 15 orders. It's incredible."" Although he already had viral plant videos on the app before joining TikTok Shop, it ""didn't equal sales the way that it now can, with the link right there in the video,"" Hurst said. Live selling online first emerged in China several years ago and exploded during the pandemic. Two-thirds of Chinese consumers purchased a product via livestream within the previous year, according to a 2020 survey. In 2022, an estimated $500 billion in goods were sold via livestream in China, accounting for about 23% of all e-commerce sales in the country, according to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. Two of China's top live-streamers were able to sell $3 billion worth of goods in one day in October 2021. Although the phenomenon hasn't quite reached that scale yet in the U.S., platforms like Amazon, EBay and Poshmark have all launched their own live shopping features. The U.S. live selling market was expected to reach $32 billion in sales this year. Whenever I scroll through TikTok these days, I stumble upon at least one livestream pitching me a product I didn't know I needed. Lately, it's been a fast-talking man extolling the virtues of an electric scrubber. As he demonstrated its efficacy on a shower door recently, I pondered whether I should be deep-cleaning my bathtub. ""Thank you for your new orders, thank you thank you,"" he said as he aggressively rang a bell. ""You are doing a fantastic job."" Next, a woman was holding up the OQQ bodysuits that have been viral on TikTok for a while. I had been thinking about buying them for months. She wore one herself, as did another model who slipped in and out of frame. ""Go ahead and snag them while they're hot for sure,"" she said. ""We are already selling out today."" I entered my height and weight into the chat to ask what size I should purchase. I was surprised to hear her address me by name. ""Jaimie, we're out of stock of the extra small, so I'd go with the small,"" she said. With her blessing, I tapped ""buy,"" selected my size, and checked out with Apple Pay. Thirty seconds later, my brain humming from the dopamine hit, I'm back to scrolling through my usual TikTok feed and looking for the video that will pique my interest next. Pitching the pitchers I did not make my first purchase on TikTok Shop without a fair bit of skepticism. Were all these products low-quality, drop-shipped items from overseas? Were they cheap knockoffs from unknown Chinese companies, like many listings on Amazon? Given some of the cut-rate prices, I couldn't help but draw comparisons to companies like Shein, Temu, AliExpress and Wish, where it's often a toss-up whether the item you just ordered will be of durable quality or complete junk. The biggest barrier to more widespread adoption of social e-commerce is consumer trust, said Laura Gurski, North America commerce lead at Accenture Song. This is especially true among older demographics who are used to buying from reliable retailers and brands. This is why sellers earnestly pitching their own products can do to such great effect through TikTok videos. They're in part borrowing tactics you might see on shopping channels like QVC, where trained hosts create intimacy with the viewer by gushing over products like they're gossiping with a friend. But unlike perfectly polished QVC hosts in a studio, the TikTok entrepreneur is unfiltered and up close - sometimes even awkwardly so - right there on your phone screen. Father-son duo Michael and Daniel Jay of San Diego started their brand Lazy Butt Club as a revamp of Michael's old T-shirt designs from decades ago. They went from less than 100 orders a year to 3,000 in a few weeks after their first viral TikTok video in 2021. ""Ever since we switched to being more personal and showing you what we're doing and our story, it's been a lot easier to resonate with people,"" said Daniel, who runs the TikTok account. In one video, I watched Michael pull out one of his hand-drawn rough drafts of a T-shirt design out of a box. In another, he screen printed ""Tyrannosaurus Wrecks"" onto a crew neck, telling viewers that it would be the first one he's printed in 25 years. They joined TikTok Shop over the summer, generating a few thousand orders since then through both the platform and their website. It's opened up new avenues of business for them. ""One of the intimidating things about trying to work with influencers is having that business side already figured out, like how to pay them,"" Daniel said. ""I kind of didn't even know how to formulate a message and ask people, like how much should they get paid or whatever."" Sellers like the Jays help TikTok establish trust, so the platform has been aggressively courting them with a variety of incentives, such as covering the cost of free shipping for some buyers and offering frequent sales and coupons. ""When we first signed up, we were like, wait - free shipping, like what do you mean free shipping? What is this sale?"" Daniel said. He was amazed to learn that a customer could purchase one of their shirts for as low as $8, while his company received the full price. With all the perks, several sellers said they don't even list items on Amazon because they consider the process too complicated or time-consuming, and the site generates too few sales. Chief Executive and founder Jay Nagy launched the Ocean Healed My Eczema in July directly onto TikTok shop. In just three months, he said he's sold more than $1 million worth of eczema cream through the platform. It went viral with the help of creators like Beaupre, and through Nagy's videos about his own experience with eczema. ""TikTok Shop is so smart, it just puts it in front of the right people. It's really wild,"" Nagy said. ""They gave me the platform to really tell my story with my struggle with eczema."" When I first discovered Nagy's product, it was through a series of videos from creators that appeared during my daily TikTok binge-scrolling session. I have watched enough testimonials - more than 10 - to be convinced of its effectiveness. But I haven't bought the cream. After all, I don't have eczema. So I obviously don't need it. Right?
